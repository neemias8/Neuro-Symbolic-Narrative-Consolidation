– It's not your usual story of a rich woman pouring perfume on a poor man, but that's exactly what happened to Jesus, according to the Bible. In the Gospel of Matthew, a woman broke a jar of perfume and poured it on the head of Jesus while he was reclining at a table. His disciples were indignant, asking, "Why this waste of perfume? It could have been sold for more than a year's wages and the money given to the poor." Jesus' reply: "She has done a beautiful thing to me. The poor you will always have with you, but you will not always have me. When she poured this perfume on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial. I tell you the truth, wherever this gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her." Click for more on the story.

Meanwhile a large crowd of Jews found out that Jesus was there and came, not only because of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus as well, for on account of him many of the Jews were going over to Jesus and putting their faith in him.

The next day the great crowd that had come for the Feast heard that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. They took palm branches and went out to meet him, shouting, "Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!Blessed is the King of Israel!"

– It's the story of a donkey and a cloak, followed by a king who sits on a donkey's colt—and it's a story that's been told before, but apparently didn't make much sense to those who weren't around at the time. "At first his disciples did not understand all this. Only after Jesus was glorified did they realize that these things had been written about him and that they had done these things to him," writes Ken Tucker in a look at the story from the Gospel of John. The story begins when Jesus sent his disciples to a village and found a young colt tied to a donkey. "Untie it and bring it here," he said. "If anyone asks you, 'Why are you doing this?' tell him, 'The Lord needs it and will send it back here shortly.'" Those who were sent ahead found the colt, tied at a doorway, and untied it. As they were untying it, its owners asked them, "Why aren't you doing it?" They replied, "TheLord needs it." They brought it to Jesus, threw their cloaks on the colt and put Jesus on it. He sat upon it, as it is written, "Do

– The Vatican today issued a warning to members of the Catholic Church, saying that while it is true that some Catholics are straying from the church's teachings, it is "in no way reflective of the attitude of the church as a whole," the AP reports. In a statement, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith said that the church "must be guided by the Lord's will, which is in the best interest of the body and the people." The warning comes a day after the Vatican announced that it is investigating allegations that some members are receiving improper payments for using the church website.

As he approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it and said, "If you, even you, had only known on this day what would bring you peace--but now it is hidden from your eyes. The days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you and encircle you and hem you in on every side. They will dash you to the ground, you and the children within your walls. They will not leave one stone on another, because you did not recognize the time of God's coming to you."

– The New York Times is out with a correction to an old story about Jesus, and it's a doozy. The original account of the Gospel of Matthew says that when Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred and asked, "Who is this?" The crowds answered, "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." The Times explains that the crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to spread the word. Many people, because they had heard that he had given this miraculous sign, went out to meet him. So the Pharisees said to one another, "See, this is getting us nowhere. Look how the whole world has gone after him!"

– The New York Times is out with a correction to a story about Jesus that first appeared in the Sunday newspaper. The original story says that Jesus entered Jerusalem and went to the temple. He looked around at everything, but since it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the Twelve. The Times has now corrected the story to say that Jesus went to Jerusalem and then went to Bethany, not that he entered Jerusalem.

– It's the story of a hungry Jesus who found nothing but leaves from a fig tree. He then tells his disciples, "May no one ever eat fruit from you again." The account comes from the Gospel of John, and it's a pretty remarkable one: As the story goes, Jesus was on his way back to the city from Bethany, and he saw a fig by the road. He went up to it to see if it had any fruit, but when he reached the leaves, he found nothing. The next day, as he was leaving Bethany, he was hungry again and went to the fig. He found nothing, but leaves, because it wasn't the season for figs. Then he said to the tree, " May no one never eat fruit." His disciples heard him say it. Read it in full here.

– It's a story that's familiar to anyone who's ever set foot in a Christian church, but it's got a new twist: It comes from the New Testament, and it involves Jesus driving out people who were selling doves. "It is written," he said to them, "'My house will be called a house of prayer,' but you are making it a 'den of robbers.'" As he drove through the temple area, he overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of the dove sellers, reports the Los Angeles Times. "Is it not written?" he asked them, as per the story in the Gospel of John. "' My house will been called a House of Prayer for all nations'? But you have made it 'a den of robbers.'" He drove them out again.

– It's a tale of self-doubt, self-pity, and a bit of a conspiracy theory, but it's one that's been around for a long time. It comes from the book of Lao Tzu, and it tells the tale of a man who, after having been killed by a group of gods, decided to live another day. He went to a temple and began teaching the people how to read and write. The people loved it, and so the chief priests, teachers of the law, and the leaders of the people started looking for a way to kill him. But they couldn't find any way to do so, because all the people hung on his words. The chief priests and the teachers of a law heard this and began looking for the way to murder him. The whole crowd was amazed at his teaching. Every day he was teaching at the temple. They feared him, for they thought he was a threat. But the people loved him. They could not find any ways to do it, because they hung on the words of his.

The blind and the lame came to him at the temple, and he healed them. But when the chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did and the children shouting in the temple area, "Hosanna to the Son of David," they were indignant. "Do you hear what these children are saying?" they asked him. "Yes," replied Jesus, "have you never read, "'From the lips of children and infants you have ordained praise'?"

When evening came, they went out of the city.

Each day Jesus was teaching at the temple, and each evening he went out to spend the night on the hill called the Mount of Olives, and all the people came early in the morning to hear him at the temple.

– The story of Jesus' crucifixion is one of the most well-known stories in Christian history, and it's a story that's getting a lot of attention these days, thanks to a New York Times op-ed by Rich Lowry, who argues that we've been so brainwashed by our culture that we don't really believe in God—and that if we're going to believe in him, we need to get out of our own ways and follow him. Lowry lays out his argument in a piece titled, "How We Can Let Go of Our Stereotypes" that appears in today's Wall Street Journal, and he lays out a number of reasons why, among them: We've become so wrapped up in our own culture that "we forget that God is bigger than us and that His will is just, and that He wants us to be perfect." We're so busy trying to figure out what to do and how to do things that we forget that He's "bigger than us, bigger than everything we do." We need to let go of our "tribalism" and recognize that "God is more than us." We can't just be grateful for what we have. We have to take responsibility for how we

– It's not every day that a Christian website goes on the offensive against Mormons, but that's exactly what's happening in Utah. The Salt Lake Tribune reports on a "relentless" campaign on Facebook and Twitter by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which is trying to get its message out to as many people as it can. "We're not here to attack Mormons," says the head of the church's social media department. Instead, "we're here to proclaim the good news of God's unconditional love for everyone." The anti-Mormon campaign includes not only attacks on Mormonism's "deeply flawed" theology, but also attacks on its opposition to same-sex marriage, abortion, and contraception. "It's time for Mormons to stand up and say, 'We are not your brothers and sisters,'" says a church spokesman. "That's who we are. That's what our faith is all about." To that end, the church has set up a page on its Facebook page called "Mormons vs. Homosexuals." It notes that the "sexual revolution" of the 1970s and '80s left many Mormons "

"What do you think? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first and said, 'Son, go and work today in the vineyard.' "'I will not,' he answered, but later he changed his mind and went. "Then the father went to the other son and said the same thing. He answered, 'I will, sir,' but he did not go. "Which of the two did what his father wanted?The first," they answered. Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you. For John came to you to show you the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did. And even after you saw this, you did not repent and believe him.

– "May this never be!" That's how the Christian Science Monitor sums up a story from the Bible about a man's decision to send his son to live with tenants in his vineyard. But when the tenants saw the son, they decided to kill him for his inheritance. "Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?" the story's author asks in the Monitor. "And he will rent the vineyard to other tenants, who will give him his share of the crop at harvest time." The tenants' response: "He will bring those wretches to a wretched end." The story, which the Monitor says dates back to the Gospel of John, is based on the story of a man who planted a vineyard, rented it to farmers, and went away on a journey. At harvest time, he sent his servant to the tenants to collect the fruit. The tenants seized him, beat him, and sent him away empty-handed. Then he sent another servant to them; they struck this man on the head and treated him shamefully. He sent still another, and that one they beat, others they killed." But the tenants said to one another, "This is the heir. Come, let

– It's not every day that you get the chance to go to the movies with your kids, but that's exactly what happened this week at a middle school in Texas. After students at Alpine Middle School in Alpine, Texas, were told by a teacher that their 8-year-old daughter was being taken to the hospital for a blood clot on her lung, one of the students offered to pay for her plane ticket back to Texas, the San Antonio Express-News reports. The little girl's mother agreed, and the school bought her a ticket to San Antonio, where her daughter was to be treated for the clot. "It's a small price to pay to save a child's life," said the principal at the school, which is located just a few miles from the Texas border. "She's the kind of kid who, if she doesn't do the right thing, she's going to regret it for the rest of her life." The principal said the girl, who was unhurt in the crash, will be released from the hospital in a few days.

– When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' parable, they knew he was talking about them. They looked for a way to arrest him, "but they were afraid of the crowd because the people held that he was a prophet." So they left him and went away, reports the Gospel of John.

Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying: "The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son. He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the banquet to tell them to come, but they refused to come. "Then he sent some more servants and said, 'Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner: My oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.' "But they paid no attention and went off--one to his field, another to his business. The rest seized his servants, mistreated them and killed them. The king was enraged. He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city. "Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding banquet is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come. Go to the street corners and invite to the banquet anyone you find.' So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad, and the wedding hall was filled with guests. "But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes. 'Friend,' he asked, 'how did you get in here without wedding clothes?' The man was speechless. "Then the king told the attendants, 'Tie him hand and foot, and throw him outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.' "For many are invited, but few are chosen."

– When it comes to the Catholic Church, there's a lot of finger-pointing going on, and the latest flare-up is over the church's opposition to same-sex marriage. At a Sunday service in St. Louis, Cardinal Donald Wuerl took a question from a woman who wanted to know why the church didn't do more to stop anti-gay discrimination, the AP reports. "I'm a firm believer in marriage as a union between one man and one woman," he said. "That's the way it should be." The church has taken heat from conservatives for not doing more to prevent discrimination against gays and lesbians, and some church leaders have called for a boycott of the upcoming Catholic Church conclave in Baltimore. "We don't believe in gay marriage. We believe in the equal rights of all people," said the archbishop of Chicago. "If you're against it, then you shouldn't be a member of the church." At the Sunday service, Wuerla defended his church, saying it had "consistently supported and encouraged" gay rights throughout history, the Chicago Tribune reports. He said the church had "heard from many people" that they were uncomfortable with gay marriage,

– If you're looking for proof that Jesus Christ is still alive, look no further than the story of the seven brothers who "were married to her" at the time of their death, according to the New York Times' retelling of the story. "At the resurrection, people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven," Jesus says. "When the dead rise, they will neither marriage nor be gave in marriage." The Times says the story is based on the account of Moses, who wrote that if a man dies without having children, his brother must marry the widow and have children for him. The seven brothers were all married to the same woman when they died. "You are in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God," he said. " at the resurrection people willneither marry nor been given in Marriage; theywill be likethe angels in Heaven." (Read the full story here.)

– When Jesus was asked which of the commandments was the greatest in the law, one of the teachers of the law asked him, "Of all the commandments, which is the most important?" He replied, "The most important one is this: 'Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, theLord is one. Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all you soul and with ALL your mind and with All your strength.'" The man replied, and from then on, no one dared ask him any more questions. "Well said, teacher," the man replied. "You are right in saying that God is one and there is no other but him." When Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, “You are not far from the kingdom of God.”

– The New York Times is out with a story about Jesus that's getting a lot of attention: It's about the son of David. In the story, Jesus asks the Pharisees, "What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?" They reply, "The son ofDavid." He then asks, "How is it that they say the Christ is the Son of David?" The disciples' reply: "The Lord said to my Lord: 'Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet.' If then David calls him 'Lord,' how can he be his son?" David declares in the Book of Psalms that he is indeed the son, and he declares that in the Lord's telling, he "made your enemies a footstool for your feet." The Times says it's the first time the story of David's son has gotten this much attention in decades.

– When it comes to the Christian faith, the belief that Jesus Christ is the Son of God has been held up as a model for generations of Christians—and it's a model that's being called into question by some Christian leaders, the Los Angeles Times reports. According to the Bible, Jesus told his followers: "Do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach. They tie up heavy loads and put them on men's shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them. Everything they do is done for men to see: They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long. They love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues; they love to be greeted in the marketplaces and to have men call them 'Rabbi.' But you are not to be called 'Rabbi,' for you have only one Master and you are all brothers. And do not call anyone on earth 'father,'" he said. "For you have one Father, and he is in heaven. Nor are you to be named 'teacher,' because you have just one teacher, the Christ. The greatest among you will be your servant. For whoever

"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut the kingdom of heaven in men's faces. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those enter who are trying to. See Footnote "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of hell as you are. "Woe to you, blind guides! You say, 'If anyone swears by the temple, it means nothing; but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath.' You blind fools! Which is greater: the gold, or the temple that makes the gold sacred? You also say, 'If anyone swears by the altar, it means nothing; but if anyone swears by the gift on it, he is bound by his oath.' You blind men! Which is greater: the gift, or the altar that makes the gift sacred? Therefore, he who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it. And he who swears by the temple swears by it and by the one who dwells in it. And he who swears by heaven swears by God's throne and by the one who sits on it. "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices--mint, dill and cummin. But you have neglected the more important matters of the law--justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former. You blind guides! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel. "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence. Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside also will be clean. "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean. In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness. "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous. And you say, 'If we had lived in the days of our forefathers, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.' So you testify against yourselves that you are the descendants of those who murdered the prophets. Fill up, then, the measure of the sin of your forefathers! "You snakes! You brood of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to hell? Therefore I am sending you prophets and wise men and teachers. Some of them you will kill and crucify; others you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town. And so upon you will come all the righteous blood that has been shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar. I tell you the truth, all this will come upon this generation.

"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing. Look, your house is left to you desolate. For I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'"

– When it comes to the importance of giving back to the community that's given so much to you, there's no better place than the aisles of your local Walmart. That's because, as the Christian Post points out, Walmart is one of the largest single Givers of Free Stuff in the world, with more than 200 million boxes of diapers, toilet paper, clothes, and other supplies handed out each year to people in need around the world. And as the Post notes, Walmart's motto is "Giving Thanks, Not Just For Themselves"—so if you're in the market for a new pair of pants or a new set of shoes, you'll want to pick up a few of these free givers from the aisles. In fact, Walmart has been giving away free stuff to its employees for more than 100 years, and it's been doing it for a while now. "It's not about making money," says a Walmart spokesperson, "it's about sharing the love of God with everyone we meet." The Post notes that Walmart is in the midst of a "Throttle Your Love" campaign to spread the word about how giving back is good for you, as well as how you can help those in

– The New York Times has a fascinating piece on the final days of Jesus' life, in which he is said to have been walking away from a temple when his disciples came up to him to call his attention. "Do you see all these things?" he asked. "I tell you the truth, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down." As he was leaving the temple, one of his disciples said to him, "Look, Teacher! What massive stones! What magnificent buildings!" But Jesus replied, "Do You See All These Great Buildings?" and then got even more specific. "As for what you see here," he said, "the time will come when not one Stone will be Left on Another; Every One of them will be tossed down." Click for the full story.

– "When will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are all about to be fulfilled?" That's what Jesus' disciples asked him as he sat on the Mount of Olives, according to the Gospel of John. But Jesus wasn't having it. "Tell us," he replied, "when will this happen, and what will been the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?" His disciples continued, "And what will you say to them that are in the presence of you? What will they say to you that you are the Son of God?" He didn't answer them, but said to them, "You are my disciples, and you are my friends." The disciples believed him and continued to ask him questions. The next day, they went to a temple and asked Jesus the same question.

– It's not the kind of headline you'd expect to see in a newspaper, but that's exactly what happened in the case of a South Carolina woman who got fired from her job as a special education teacher for refusing to take a lie-detector test, the Charlotte Observer reports. Police say 46-year-old Kimberly Stinnett was let go after refusing to submit to a test that would have revealed her husband's criminal history. She had been teaching special education for more than 20 years and had been with the Greenville County school system for less than a month when she got a call from a co-worker who said she had been fired. "I am so sorry for the poor judgment of this individual," said a statement from the school system. "This individual should not have been given the opportunity to teach special education to our children." Stinsnett says she didn't realize she was being fired until she got to work the next day. She tells the Observer that she was told her job had been terminated because she refused to take the test. She says she had no idea it was a lie detector test, and that when she refused one, a sheriff's deputy told her to lie down on the ground and wait for the

– When the Bible is read today, it's not in its original form, but the New York Times has pulled together some of its favorite passages to give us a taste of what's to come. Among the highlights: King David's warning about the coming apocalypse: "Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be great earthquakes, famines, and pestilences in various places, and fearful events and great signs from heaven." The reading from Matthew: "But before all this, they will lay hands on you and persecute you. They will deliver you to synagogues and prisons, and you will be brought before kings and governors, and all on account of my name. This will result in your being witnesses to them. But make up your mind not to worry beforehand how you will defend yourselves. For I will give you words and wisdom that none of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict. You will be betrayed even by parents, brothers, relatives and friends, and they will put some of you to death. All men will hate you because of me, but he who stands firm to the end will be saved. When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed. Such things must happen,

– President Trump's tariff war with China isn't just bad for the US: It's bad for China, too, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of tariffs Trump imposed on goods from China over the weekend. The Journal says the White House hasn't confirmed the report, but it notes that tariffs on Chinese goods could cause a trade war between the US and China that could last months or even years. The analysis also takes a look at China's role in the global economy and its effect on the US. Trump has said he wants to reduce the trade deficit with China, which he blames for US trade deficits. China has responded by slapping tariffs on a host of US products, including cars, wine, and steel. The White House says Trump is simply trying to "counter the unfair trade advantage China has enjoyed for a long time." The Journal notes that China is one of the biggest trading partners of the US, and Trump has made no secret of his desire to hit China with tariffs.

– President Trump's tariff fight with China appears to be only getting nastier. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed, Trump argues that China is "attempting to meddle in the internal affairs of the United States" and is trying to keep the country from reaping the benefits of his tariffs on goods from its biggest trading partner. Trump says he's asked Chinese President Xi Jinping to help with the trade fight, but hasn't been able to get a reply. "I've asked the president of China to help," Trump writes. "And I'm awaiting a response from him." Trump says China has been trying to "snatch away" some of the intellectual property that the US has reaped because of the tariffs it's putting into place on Chinese goods. The Journal notes that China has threatened to retaliate against the US if it doesn't cut off its imports of steel, aluminum, cotton, rice, and other goods, and has suggested that it might take action against US companies that don't comply. The White House says Trump has been in touch with Chinese officials, and that Trump has told Xi that "the time is now" for a trade deal, the Journal reports. (In other Trump news, a GOP senator says

– In the wake of the Orlando shooting, the nation is taking a fresh look at gun control—and at gun laws. Here are five things you need to know about gun control in America, courtesy of the Southern Poverty Law Center, the Wall Street Journal, and the National Conference of State Legislatures: President Trump's support for gun-control measures isn't sitting well with most Americans, according to a poll conducted by NPR and the Center for Public Integrity. Some 63% of Americans say gun control is "inadequate" or "not at all safe," compared to 19% who say it's "extreme" and 23% who call it "ineffective." Trump has said he wants to see tougher gun laws, including background checks and background checks on people buying guns, but some say he doesn't have the money to do so. "I don't know what I'm going to do," Trump said when asked if he'd support tougher gun control. "My guess is we're going to see more and more extreme gun control." The president of the National Association of Black Journalists says his group is "deeply troubled" by gun control measures being considered by some states, including California, which has banned assault weapons and high-capacity magazines

– In the Bible, Jesus tells a story about a fig tree and its leaves coming out of the ground. "When they sprout leaves, you can see for yourselves and know that summer is near," he says. "Even so, when you see these things happening, you know that the kingdom of God is near." The New York Times points out that the story has a lot to do with the coming of the Messiah. In the Gospel of John, Jesus says, "This generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away."

– "No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father." That's the message from a New York Times Magazine cover story that's getting a lot of attention this week. The cover story is on a piece by David Remnick in the New Yorker, and Remnick's take is that it's "a scathing indictment of the nation's political leaders"—and of President Trump in particular. Remnick writes that Trump has been "an embarrassment" to the country, and that his "obsession" with "fake news" has "destroyed the credibility" of the entire political process. He also takes issue with some of Trump's own statements, including his claim that the government doesn't need congressional approval before spending "massive amounts of money" on border security. "I don't know what else to call it," he writes. "It's a waste of money, and I'm angry about it." He goes on to say that Trump is a "total disaster" for the country and that "if he wants to govern this country, he's going to have to do a lot more of the same things that have made this country

As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark; and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.

Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left. Two women will be grinding with a hand mill; one will be taken and the other left. "Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come. But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into.

– If you've ever wondered what it's like to live under the shadow of Jesus Christ, you're in good company. The Bible says that when the Son of Man comes, he'll "come at an hour when you do not expect him," and those who don't prepare will be doomed, the Telegraph reports. "Be careful, or your hearts will be weighed down with dissipation, drunkenness, and the anxieties of life, and that day will close on you unexpectedly like a trap," says the Gospel of John. "For it will come upon all those who live on the face of the whole earth. Be always on the watch, and pray that you may be able to escape all that is about to happen."

"At that time the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were foolish and five were wise. The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take any oil with them. The wise, however, took oil in jars along with their lamps. The bridegroom was a long time in coming, and they all became drowsy and fell asleep. "At midnight the cry rang out: 'Here's the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!' "Then all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps. The foolish ones said to the wise, 'Give us some of your oil; our lamps are going out.' "'No,' they replied, 'there may not be enough for both us and you. Instead, go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.' "But while they were on their way to buy the oil, the bridegroom arrived. The virgins who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet. And the door was shut. "Later the others also came. 'Sir! Sir!' they said. 'Open the door for us!' "But he replied, 'I tell you the truth, I don't know you.' "Therefore keep watch, because you do not know the day or the hour.

"Again, it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted his property to them. To one he gave five talents of money, to another two talents, and to another one talent, each according to his ability. Then he went on his journey. The man who had received the five talents went at once and put his money to work and gained five more. So also, the one with the two talents gained two more. But the man who had received the one talent went off, dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money. "After a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them. The man who had received the five talents brought the other five. 'Master,' he said, 'you entrusted me with five talents. See, I have gained five more.' "His master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!' "The man with the two talents also came. 'Master,' he said, 'you entrusted me with two talents; see, I have gained two more.' "His master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!' "Then the man who had received the one talent came. 'Master,' he said, 'I knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed. So I was afraid and went out and hid your talent in the ground. See, here is what belongs to you.' "His master replied, 'You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed? Well then, you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers, so that when I returned I would have received it back with interest. "'Take the talent from him and give it to the one who has the ten talents. For everyone who has will be given more, and he will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him. And throw that worthless servant outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'

"When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his throne in heavenly glory. All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left. "Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.' "Then the righteous will answer him, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?' "The King will reply, 'I tell you the truth, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me.' "Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.' "They also will answer, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?' "He will reply, 'I tell you the truth, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.' "Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life."

Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the Feast. They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request. "Sir," they said, "we would like to see Jesus." Philip went to tell Andrew; Andrew and Philip in turn told Jesus. Jesus replied, "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. I tell you the truth, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds. The man who loves his life will lose it, while the man who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. Whoever serves me must follow me; and where I am, my servant also will be. My Father will honor the one who serves me. "Now my heart is troubled, and what shall I say? 'Father, save me from this hour'? No, it was for this very reason I came to this hour. Father, glorify your name!" Then a voice came from heaven, "I have glorified it, and will glorify it again." The crowd that was there and heard it said it had thundered; others said an angel had spoken to him. Jesus said, "This voice was for your benefit, not mine. Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this world will be driven out. But I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself." He said this to show the kind of death he was going to die. The crowd spoke up, "We have heard from the Law that the Christ will remain forever, so how can you say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this 'Son of Man'?" Then Jesus told them, "You are going to have the light just a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, before darkness overtakes you. The man who walks in the dark does not know where he is going. Put your trust in the light while you have it, so that you may become sons of light." When he had finished speaking, Jesus left and hid himself from them.

When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he said to his disciples, "As you know, the Passover is two days away--and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified."

– The story of how Jesus was arrested, tortured, and killed—it's a tale for the ages, but it's getting a fresh look thanks to the recent documentary Finding Jesus: The Story of a Nation That Didn't Believe in Jesus, airing on HBO next week. The documentary explores the story of the disciples who tried, unsuccessfully, to stop Jesus from emerging from the tomb, and how that story has been told over the years by a variety of sources, including the Bible, the New York Times, and the BBC. The Times has the full account of the story, which begins with the disciples gathering in the palace of a high priest to plot to kill Jesus. "But not during the Feast," they said, "or there may be a riot among the people." The chief priests and teachers of the law were afraid of the people, and they were looking for some way to get rid of Jesus.

– The story of Jesus' betrayal by Judas Iscariot gets stranger still. In the Gospel of Luke, Judas is said to have betrayed Jesus to the leaders of the Jewish temple. They promised to give him money, but then Satan entered Judas and convinced him to betray Jesus again. So he watched for an opportunity to give Jesus his money, and when no crowd was present, he gave it to the temple guards instead. The account is told in the book of Leviticus, but the New York Times points out that the Jewish version of the story has some discrepancies with the Greek version. For example, the Greek account says that Judas had been given 30 silver coins, while the Hebrew version says he was given 40, the Times notes. The Times also notes that one of the main reasons the story is so well-known is because it's retold in the Bible.

Even after Jesus had done all these miraculous signs in their presence, they still would not believe in him. This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet: "Lord, who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?" For this reason they could not believe, because, as Isaiah says elsewhere: "He has blinded their eyes and deadened their hearts, so they can neither see with their eyes, nor understand with their hearts, nor turn--and I would heal them." Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus' glory and spoke about him. Yet at the same time many even among the leaders believed in him. But because of the Pharisees they would not confess their faith for fear they would be put out of the synagogue; for they loved praise from men more than praise from God.

Then Jesus cried out, "When a man believes in me, he does not believe in me only, but in the one who sent me. When he looks at me, he sees the one who sent me. I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in me should stay in darkness. "As for the person who hears my words but does not keep them, I do not judge him. For I did not come to judge the world, but to save it. There is a judge for the one who rejects me and does not accept my words; that very word which I spoke will condemn him at the last day. For I did not speak of my own accord, but the Father who sent me commanded me what to say and how to say it. I know that his command leads to eternal life. So whatever I say is just what the Father has told me to say."

– It's that time of year again: time for us to reflect on the story of the Passover and its importance to Christians. The story begins on the first day of the week of Unleavened Bread, and it's a story of preparation, according to the Christian Science Monitor. "Go into the city to a certain man and tell him, 'The Teacher says: My appointed time is near. I am going to celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house,'" says Jesus in the Gospel of John. He instructed his disciples to make those preparations, and they did just that. The Monitor's translation: "As you enter the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him to the house that he enters, and say to the owner of the house, ' The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover With My disciples?' He will show you a large upper room, furnished and ready. Make preparations there." The disciples left, and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover. The next day was the day that the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed.

– The New York Times is out with a story about Jesus that's sure to make you scratch your head. It's about how the son of God—whom the Times describes as a "prominent Roman Catholic"—flew from Jerusalem to a remote village in Galilee, where he was greeted by a crowd of people from all over the world. The Times says it's "one of the most significant eyewitness accounts of a religious event in modern history." The story is based on the Gospel of John, which says that when the crowds gathered at the Wailing Wall, Jesus was among them. The crowd shouted, "This is the Son of God!" and "Oh Lord, why have you forsaken us?" The crowd cried out, "We are hungry! We are thirsty!" and the crowd shouted back, "Here is the Lord!" The story says that after the crowd had dispersed, Jesus went back to the apostles and told them, "You are my people, the Twelve, who are also in heaven." The crowd cheered, and the disciples shouted back: "You have not forsaken us!" The Times notes that this was the first time in history that a large crowd had gathered at a single location for a religious service, and that the

And he said to them, "I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it finds fulfillment in the kingdom of God."

It was just before the Passover Feast. Jesus knew that the time had come for him to leave this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he now showed them the full extent of his love. The evening meal was being served, and the devil had already prompted Judas Iscariot, son of Simon, to betray Jesus. Jesus knew that the Father had put all things under his power, and that he had come from God and was returning to God; so he got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around his waist. After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples' feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him. He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, "Lord, are you going to wash my feet?" Jesus replied, "You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand." "No," said Peter, "you shall never wash my feet." Jesus answered, "Unless I wash you, you have no part with me." "Then, Lord," Simon Peter replied, "not just my feet but my hands and my head as well!" Jesus answered, "A person who has had a bath needs only to wash his feet; his whole body is clean. And you are clean, though not every one of you." For he knew who was going to betray him, and that was why he said not every one was clean. When he had finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and returned to his place. "Do you understand what I have done for you?" he asked them. "You call me 'Teacher' and 'Lord,' and rightly so, for that is what I am. Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another's feet. I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you. I tell you the truth, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him. Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.

– It's a story that's been told before, but it's getting new attention thanks to a New York Times op-ed by an ex-journalist and his wife, both of whom say they were misled about Jesus' true identity. "I was misled about who I was," says Mark Oppenheimer, who wrote the Times piece for the Christian Post. "My wife and I did not know that Jesus was born in the city of Galilee, that he lived there for three years, or that he was a Nazarene." He adds, "We were led to believe that Jesus Christ was some other kind of holy man, a savior who had been sent to save us from our sins." But the Times has dug up a series of errors and inconsistencies in the story's timeline, including the fact that Jesus didn't live in Galilee until after his crucifixion, and that a key part of the story about him being misled about his true identity was actually taken out of context. The Times points out that the story is based on a "previously unpublished account" from the Bible's New Testament, and it says that when the disciples were eating, Jesus told them, "I tell you the truth, one of you is going to betray me."

– It's a story of betrayal that's familiar to anyone who's ever dipped a bowl with Jesus, and it's one that we're likely to hear a lot more of in the coming weeks and months as we read through the story of the disciples' encounter with the Son of Man. The New York Times recounts it thusly: "They were very sad and began to say to him one after the other, 'Surely not I, Lord?' Jesus replied, 'The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me. The Son of man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son-of-Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born." The disciples stared at one another, at a loss to know which of them he meant. One of them, the disciple whom Jesus loved, was reclining next to him. Simon Peter motioned to this disciple and said, "Ask him which one he means." Leaning back against Jesus, he asked him, "Lord, who is it?" The disciples were saddened, and one by one they said to him: "Surely not me?" "It is one of the Twelve," he

Jesus answered, "It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish." Then, dipping the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, son of Simon. As soon as Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him.

"What you are about to do, do quickly," Jesus told him, but no one at the meal understood why Jesus said this to him. Since Judas had charge of the money, some thought Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the Feast, or to give something to the poor. As soon as Judas had taken the bread, he went out. And it was night.

When he was gone, Jesus said, "Now is the Son of Man glorified and God is glorified in him. If God is glorified in him, God will glorify the Son in himself, and will glorify him at once. "My children, I will be with you only a little longer. You will look for me, and just as I told the Jews, so I tell you now: Where I am going, you cannot come. "A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another."

– It's a story that's been told before, but it's getting new attention now that it comes from the Christian Science Monitor. The Monitor's translation: "While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, 'Take and eat; this is my body.'" The original version of the story, which the Monitor points out is from the New International Version, has a slightly different account: "And he took Bread, gave Thanks and Broke It, and Gave It to His Disciples, saying; 'This is my Body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.'" The new version, however, includes the word "body" in the original version, so it'll be interesting to see how the new version translates.

– The story of Jesus Christ's first public appearance is one of the most famous in Christian history, and it's a story that's getting a lot of attention these days. The New York Times revisits the story of the first time the Messiah appeared in public, to a small group of men in Galilee. The men had no idea who he was, but they all knew him as "Messiah" because of the miracles he had done in his life. One of them, a scribe named David, asked Jesus if he was the Messiah, and the answer he gave was a simple, "Yes." David had been commissioned by Jesus to write a letter to the people of Galilee, and he had given the men a cup to drink. Jesus took the cup and said to the men, "This is my blood, which is poured out for many. Drink from it, all of you." The men all drank from the cup, and David was so moved by the gesture that he wrote a letter of thanks to Jesus. The Times notes that the disciples of David, known as the Davidians, were not exactly thrilled with the idea of the Messiah in their midst, and that one of their leaders, David's son David, had to flee the

– The story of Jesus Christ's crucifixion and death is a well-known one, but the New York Times says it's a little different today. In the Gospel of John, Jesus is recorded as saying this: "I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father's kingdom." He then goes on to say that he won't drink any more of the fruit until he's able to drink it " anew in the kingdom of God." The Times explains that the line is a reference to the Sermon on the Mount, in which he says, "And God said to them, ‘Eli,Eli, Eli, I am the Lord your God.' And the people said to him, ‘How can you?'" So he gave the people a cup and told them, "Take this and divide it among you. For I tell you I will not drinks again of the Fruit of the Vine until the Kingdom of God comes." The story is told in three parts, the first in the book of Matthew, the second in Luke, and the third in John. The first part tells the story of how the disciples found Jesus in the desert; the second part

Also a dispute arose among them as to which of them was considered to be greatest. Jesus said to them, "The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those who exercise authority over them call themselves Benefactors. But you are not to be like that. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who rules like the one who serves. For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who is at the table? But I am among you as one who serves. You are those who have stood by me in my trials. And I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred one on me, so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

– It's the story of a man who says he's ready to go to prison and die for the faith that led him to Christ. But when he says that, Jesus responds, "I tell you, Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will deny three times that you know me." As the story goes, a man named Simon asked Jesus, "Lord, where are you going?" Jesus replied, "Where I am going, you cannot follow now, but you will follow later." Then he says to Peter, "Will you really lay down your life for me? I will lay down my life for you." The man's response: "Lord. Why can't I follow you now?" The man then asks, " Lord, why couldn't you follow me now?" Jesus' reply: "I will lay Down my Life for You."

"Do not let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God; trust also in me. In my Father's house are many rooms; if it were not so, I would have told you. I am going there to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am. You know the way to the place where I am going." Thomas said to him, "Lord, we don't know where you are going, so how can we know the way?" Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. If you really knew me, you would know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him." Philip said, "Lord, show us the Father and that will be enough for us." Jesus answered: "Don't you know me, Philip, even after I have been among you such a long time? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, 'Show us the Father'? Don't you believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words I say to you are not just my own. Rather, it is the Father, living in me, who is doing his work. Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; or at least believe on the evidence of the miracles themselves. I tell you the truth, anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing. He will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father. And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Son may bring glory to the Father. You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.

"If you love me, you will obey what I command. And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Counselor to be with you forever-- the Spirit of truth. The world cannot accept him, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be in you. I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you. Before long, the world will not see me anymore, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live. On that day you will realize that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you. Whoever has my commands and obeys them, he is the one who loves me. He who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I too will love him and show myself to him." Then Judas (not Judas Iscariot) said, "But, Lord, why do you intend to show yourself to us and not to the world?" Jesus replied, "If anyone loves me, he will obey my teaching. My Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him. He who does not love me will not obey my teaching. These words you hear are not my own; they belong to the Father who sent me. "All this I have spoken while still with you. But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you. Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid. "You heard me say, 'I am going away and I am coming back to you.' If you loved me, you would be glad that I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I. I have told you now before it happens, so that when it does happen you will believe. I will not speak with you much longer, for the prince of this world is coming. He has no hold on me, but the world must learn that I love the Father and that I do exactly what my Father has commanded me.

Then Jesus asked them, "When I sent you without purse, bag or sandals, did you lack anything?Nothing," they answered. He said to them, "But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one. It is written: 'And he was numbered with the transgressors'; and I tell you that this must be fulfilled in me. Yes, what is written about me is reaching its fulfillment." The disciples said, "See, Lord, here are two swords.That is enough," he replied.

– "Come now; let us leave." That's what Jesus said to his followers as they went out to the Mount of Olives to worship on Sunday, the New York Times reports. The disciples, who were led by John the Baptist, were following the example of Jesus' mother, Mary, who said to her husband, "Let us go to the mountain and not return to our house." The Times notes that the disciples were led to the peak of the mountain by a golden-haired man in a baseball cap, and that the man was dressed as a priest.

– The story of how Jesus' disciples first came to believe that he is the Son of God is a fascinating one, and the New York Times has a nice explainer on it. The key quote: "This very night you will all fall away on account of me, for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.' But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee." Peter: "Even if all Fall Away on Account of You, I Never will." Jesus: "I tell you the truth, this very night, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times." But Peter insisted emphatically, "Even If I have to die with you, I Will Never Disown You." All the other disciples said the same. "You will all Fall away," Jesus told them, "for it is wrote: ' I willstrike the shepherd, and The sheep will be Scattered.' but after I Have risen,I will go Ahead of You into Galilee.' Peter declared, 'Even if All Fall Away I will Not.'"

"I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener. He cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit, while every branch that does bear fruit he prunes so that it will be even more fruitful. You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you. Remain in me, and I will remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me. "I am the vine; you are the branches. If a man remains in me and I in him, he will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing. If anyone does not remain in me, he is like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned. If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be given you. This is to my Father's glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples. "As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Now remain in my love. If you obey my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have obeyed my Father's commands and remain in his love. I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete. My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends. You are my friends if you do what I command. I no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know his master's business. Instead, I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you. You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit--fruit that will last. Then the Father will give you whatever you ask in my name. This is my command: Love each other.

"If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you. Remember the words I spoke to you: 'No servant is greater than his master.' If they persecuted me, they will persecute you also. If they obeyed my teaching, they will obey yours also. They will treat you this way because of my name, for they do not know the One who sent me. If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin. Now, however, they have no excuse for their sin. He who hates me hates my Father as well. If I had not done among them what no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin. But now they have seen these miracles, and yet they have hated both me and my Father. But this is to fulfill what is written in their Law: 'They hated me without reason.' "When the Counselor comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father, he will testify about me. And you also must testify, for you have been with me from the beginning. "All this I have told you so that you will not go astray. They will put you out of the synagogue; in fact, a time is coming when anyone who kills you will think he is offering a service to God. They will do such things because they have not known the Father or me. I have told you this, so that when the time comes you will remember that I warned you. I did not tell you this at first because I was with you.

"Now I am going to him who sent me, yet none of you asks me, 'Where are you going?' Because I have said these things, you are filled with grief. But I tell you the truth: It is for your good that I am going away. Unless I go away, the Counselor will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you. When he comes, he will convict the world of guilt in regard to sin and righteousness and judgment: in regard to sin, because men do not believe in me; in regard to righteousness, because I am going to the Father, where you can see me no longer; and in regard to judgment, because the prince of this world now stands condemned. "I have much more to say to you, more than you can now bear. But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to come. He will bring glory to me by taking from what is mine and making it known to you. All that belongs to the Father is mine. That is why I said the Spirit will take from what is mine and make it known to you.

"In a little while you will see me no more, and then after a little while you will see me." Some of his disciples said to one another, "What does he mean by saying, 'In a little while you will see me no more, and then after a little while you will see me,' and 'Because I am going to the Father'?" They kept asking, "What does he mean by 'a little while'? We don't understand what he is saying." Jesus saw that they wanted to ask him about this, so he said to them, "Are you asking one another what I meant when I said, 'In a little while you will see me no more, and then after a little while you will see me'? I tell you the truth, you will weep and mourn while the world rejoices. You will grieve, but your grief will turn to joy. A woman giving birth to a child has pain because her time has come; but when her baby is born she forgets the anguish because of her joy that a child is born into the world. So with you: Now is your time of grief, but I will see you again and you will rejoice, and no one will take away your joy. In that day you will no longer ask me anything. I tell you the truth, my Father will give you whatever you ask in my name. Until now you have not asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive, and your joy will be complete.

"Though I have been speaking figuratively, a time is coming when I will no longer use this kind of language but will tell you plainly about my Father. In that day you will ask in my name. I am not saying that I will ask the Father on your behalf. No, the Father himself loves you because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God. I came from the Father and entered the world; now I am leaving the world and going back to the Father." Then Jesus' disciples said, "Now you are speaking clearly and without figures of speech. Now we can see that you know all things and that you do not even need to have anyone ask you questions. This makes us believe that you came from God." "You believe at last!" Jesus answered. "But a time is coming, and has come, when you will be scattered, each to his own home. You will leave me all alone. Yet I am not alone, for my Father is with me. "I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world."

After Jesus said this, he looked toward heaven and prayed: "Father, the time has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son may glorify you. For you granted him authority over all people that he might give eternal life to all those you have given him. Now this is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent. I have brought you glory on earth by completing the work you gave me to do. And now, Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began. "I have revealed you to those whom you gave me out of the world. They were yours; you gave them to me and they have obeyed your word. Now they know that everything you have given me comes from you. For I gave them the words you gave me and they accepted them. They knew with certainty that I came from you, and they believed that you sent me. I pray for them. I am not praying for the world, but for those you have given me, for they are yours. All I have is yours, and all you have is mine. And glory has come to me through them. I will remain in the world no longer, but they are still in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, protect them by the power of your name--the name you gave me--so that they may be one as we are one. While I was with them, I protected them and kept them safe by that name you gave me. None has been lost except the one doomed to destruction so that Scripture would be fulfilled. "I am coming to you now, but I say these things while I am still in the world, so that they may have the full measure of my joy within them. I have given them your word and the world has hated them, for they are not of the world any more than I am of the world. My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one. They are not of the world, even as I am not of it. Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth. As you sent me into the world, I have sent them into the world. For them I sanctify myself, that they too may be truly sanctified. "My prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message, that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me. I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one: I in them and you in me. May they be brought to complete unity to let the world know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me. "Father, I want those you have given me to be with me where I am, and to see my glory, the glory you have given me because you loved me before the creation of the world. "Righteous Father, though the world does not know you, I know you, and they know that you have sent me. I have made you known to them, and will continue to make you known in order that the love you have for me may be in them and that I myself may be in them."

– When it comes to the Bible, the Old and New Testaments are one and the same, but in the New Testament, there's a big difference. In the Gospel of John, Jesus recounts a series of events that took place in the days before his crucifixion. Here are some highlights from the story, which is believed to have been written by someone else: The story: When Jesus and his followers went to a place called Gethsemane, he told them, "Sit here while I go over there and pray." He took Peter, James, and John along with him, and he began to be troubled. "My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death," he said to them. "Stay here and keep watch with me." When he had finished praying, he left with his disciples and crossed the Kidron Valley. On the other side there was an olive grove. On their way into it, he and his disciples said, "Pray that you will not fall into temptation."

– The story of Jesus is a tale of suffering, but it's also a story of triumph. The New York Times today shares the story of how, after a long day of prayer, he was able to go back to his disciples and tell them that he had risen from the dead. It's not clear exactly how he got to that point, but the Times says he went to a deserted spot in the desert and implored his disciples, "Abba, Father, take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will." The disciples, exhausted from his prayers, fell asleep.

– It's a story about a group of disciples who fell asleep with a cup in their hands, and it's one about a king who didn't want his court to get involved in a brawl. But it has a happy ending. The New York Times recounts the story of King David, who was unhappy with the behavior of his court, so he sent David's brother, David, to fetch the cup. David had no choice but to fetch it, because David was angry at his brother, and David feared that David would throw the cup at him. David threw the cup in his brother's face, but David managed to get it out of his hands and into the court room. David then called his brother and told him that he could not have the cup if he did not give it to his court. David refused to give it, and the court ordered him to give the cup to his brother. But David refused, and when his brother asked why he had not given it to him, David said, "Because I have not given you the cup." The court then ordered David to give his brother the cup, and he did so. The Times notes that David was not the first king to be unhappy with his court; it seems that

– The story of Jesus Christ's first followers is a tale of betrayal, but it's also a story of faith. The New York Times has a look at the story of Matthew 25:14, which begins: "And God said to them, 'Son of Man, be fruitful in your sight in my sight.'" The disciples believed him, but when he returned to them the second time, he found them sleeping. He said, "The hour has come. Look, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!" The disciples didn't know what to say to him. He returned the third time, saying, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Enough!" He left them again and said the same thing. So he left them and went away once more and prayed the fourth time. Then he came back and said, “Are you yet sleeping and rested? ... The hour is near." The disciples did not know what he was going to say. He came back the fifth time and said: "Here comes my betrayeder!" Read the full story here.

– Judas Isidore, the betrayer of Jesus, is getting a fresh look thanks to a new documentary that's drawing attention to the Roman Catholic's role in the downfall of the Messiah, the AP reports. The film, which is based on the book of Matthew, tells the story of how, as Jesus was teaching his disciples about the Gospel, Judas made a fateful decision to betray him. "Now the one I kiss is the man; arrest him and lead him away under guard," Judas told the crowd. When Jesus asked Judas to kiss him, he asked, "Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?" The answer to that question was a resounding "no." The documentary's director tells the AP that he was "shocked" when he saw the account of the betrayal in the Gospel of Matthew. "I thought it was a joke," he says. "It's a serious story." The story of the disciples' persecution of Jesus is told in other parts of the Bible, but this is the first time it's gotten this much attention.

Jesus, knowing all that was going to happen to him, went out and asked them, "Who is it you want?" "Jesus of Nazareth," they replied. "I am he," Jesus said. (And Judas the traitor was standing there with them.) When Jesus said, "I am he," they drew back and fell to the ground. Again he asked them, "Who is it you want?" And they said, "Jesus of Nazareth." "I told you that I am he," Jesus answered. "If you are looking for me, then let these men go." This happened so that the words he had spoken would be fulfilled: "I have not lost one of those you gave me."

– When Jesus was arrested, one of his followers struck a high priest's servant with a sword, cutting off his ear. But when Jesus' followers saw what was going to happen, they said, "Lord, should we strike with our swords?" And Jesus answered, "No more of this!" And he touched the man's ear and healed him. Then another of Jesus' companions, Simon Peter, drew his sword and struck the servant again, this time severing his right ear. (The servant's name was Malchus.) Jesus commanded Peter, "Put your sword away! Shall I not drink the cup the Father has given me?" The men seized Jesus and arrested him, and when the men stepped forward and seized him again, Jesus and his followers were arrested, too. "How then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen in this way?" asked Jesus.

– The New York Times has a fascinating look at the life of Jesus, from his humble beginnings in a small apartment to his controversial rise to fame and martyrdom. The story is based on the book of Matthew, and it recounts how, as a young man, Jesus faced down a crowd of angry men with the help of his mother, Mary Magdalene. The crowd attacked him with clubs and swords, but he managed to remain calm. "Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me?" he asked. "Every day I sat in the temple courts teaching, and you did not arrest me. But this has all taken place that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled." He then instructed his followers to flee. "But this is your hour—when darkness reigns," he said to the crowd.

– The story of how Jesus was arrested, tortured and thrown in a well has a happy ending. The New York Times recounts the tale of how the son of God was found in the well of a well in Galilee, where he had been hiding out from the Samaritans. The well was surrounded by soldiers, and when Jesus entered it, he was found by one of the soldiers. He was then beaten and thrown into the well. The soldiers had no idea who he was. They called for an ambulance, and Jesus was taken to a hospital. The next day, the soldiers found him in an empty well. He had been in hiding for two days. The Times says it's unclear whether the soldiers who found him knew he was there.

A young man, wearing nothing but a linen garment, was following Jesus. When they seized him, he fled naked, leaving his garment behind.

– The story of how Jesus was arrested and taken to Caiaphas, the high priest, is one of the most famous in Christian history, and it's a story that's getting a lot of attention thanks to a recent New York Times piece by Maureen Dowd. It begins with this line: "Those who had arrested Jesus took him to [the high priest] where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled. They took Jesus to the highpriest, and all the chief priests, elders and teachers of [the law] came together. Then seizing him, they led him away and took him into the house of the high Priest." Dowd's take: "This is the story of a group of men who, after having arrested Jesus, decided it would be a good idea to make him a high priest—and they went to great lengths to make that happen." Read it in full here.

and brought him first to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year. Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jews that it would be good if one man died for the people.

– The story of how Peter got into trouble with Jesus is a familiar one, but this time it's a little different. The account comes from the Gospel of John, and it recounts how the son of God got caught up in a dispute with Jesus over a piece of bread. Peter had been following Jesus and was about to enter the high priest's courtyard to see what would happen when he heard a voice say, "You're going to die." The high priest ordered Peter to wait outside, but he had to wait when another of his followers came back and spoke to the girl on duty. The other disciple brought Peter into the courtyard, and he got into a fight with the priest over the bread. When Peter got back to his car, the man had another argument with him, so he called his brother, Peter. The two got into an argument, and the man got angry and fled. But when Peter got home, he found himself in trouble with the authorities. So he asked his brother to call the authorities, and they sent a high priest to get him out of trouble. The authorities didn't like the way Peter was handling the situation, and ordered him to leave.

– The story of how Jesus' disciples came to know each other is a fascinating one, and it's been told before—including in the book of John. The New York Times revisits it in its current issue, and in the original version, a servant girl says to Peter, "You also were with Jesus of Galilee." He denies it, then denies it again, before the girl asks him, "Are you one of his disciples, are you?" He replies, "I am not." The Times' take: "It's not the first time the story of the disciples' relationship has been told, but it is by far the most vivid and convincing one to date." Read it here.

"I don't know or understand what you're talking about," he said, and went out into the entryway.

Meanwhile, the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching. "I have spoken openly to the world," Jesus replied. "I always taught in synagogues or at the temple, where all the Jews come together. I said nothing in secret. Why question me? Ask those who heard me. Surely they know what I said." When Jesus said this, one of the officials nearby struck him in the face. "Is this the way you answer the high priest?" he demanded. "If I said something wrong," Jesus replied, "testify as to what is wrong. But if I spoke the truth, why did you strike me?" Then Annas sent him, still bound, to Caiaphas the high priest.

– It's a story that's been told before, but it's getting new attention thanks to an account in the Gospel of John. In it, Jesus is told about a group of men who wanted to put him to death, but they didn't find any. Finally, two came forward and said, "This fellow said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'" The high priest stood up and asked, "Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?" But Jesus remained silent. "I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God," the high priest told him. "Yes, it is as you say," Jesus replied. "But I say to all of you: In the future you will see the son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven." The priest then tore his clothes and cried out, "He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, now you have heard the blasphemy. What do you think? He is worthy of death." The crowd cheered, and the priests tore their clothes

– The New York Times revisits the story of Jesus' crucifixion and death in the second half of its Sunday Magazine cover story, "The Man Who Killed Jesus." In the first half of the story, the disciples beat and mocked him, calling him "prophesy" and spitting in his face. The second half, however, focuses more on his enemies' treatment of him, with the disciples taunting and beating him as he was about to be taken to the well. "They all condemned him as worthy of death," the first story says. "Then some began to spit at him; they blindfolded him, struck him with their fists, and said, 'ProphesY!' And the guards took him and beat him." (The full story is here.)

– The story of Peter and the disciples is a fascinating one, and the New York Times has a nice explainer on it. The story begins with a servant girl who says to Peter, "This fellow is one of them." He responds, "I don't know the man!" and then denies it again, with an oath. When someone else sees him and says, "Man, I am not!" Peter replies, "As Simon Peter stood warming himself, he was asked, 'You are not one of his disciples, are you?' He denied it, saying, 'I am not.'" See the Times for more.

– The story of Peter and the rooster is one of the most famous stories in the Bible, and it's one that's getting a lot of attention these days. Here's a sample of some of the headlines making the rounds: "Peter's Father Says He's Got a Surprise for You"—The Christian Science Monitor, quoting a Bible passage that says Peter's "father was a high priest's relative who had an ear cut off." (It's not clear who the high priest was, but one of his servants was a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off.) "Peter Says He Didn't See the Man in the Olive Grove"—the New York Times, quoting an old Peter story that says the evangelist was on his way to visit a sick relative when his ear was cut off and he saw the man's relatives in the olive grove.

Immediately the rooster crowed the second time.

– "Before the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times." That's what Jesus said to Peter in the Gospel of John, and it's a line that's getting a lot of attention today. The New York Times runs through the line in detail: "Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him: 'before the rooster crowed, you'll disown Me three times.' And he went outside and wept bitterly." Read it in full at the Times.

– It's the story of a group of men who heard a voice tell them, "If you are the Christ, tell us." The elders of the people said, "tell us," and Jesus answered: "If I tell you, you will not believe me, and if I asked you ... you would not answer. But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty God." They all asked, "Are you then the son of God?" He replied, "You are right in saying I am." Then they added, "Why do we need any more testimony? We have heard it from his own lips." Jesus said to the men, "Come to me. I will show you the truth. For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." (In other words, he's dead, but God is still alive.) The elders and chief priests then made a decision to put Jesus to death. "Very early in the morning, the chief priests, with the elders, the teachers of the law, and the whole Sanhedrin, reached a decision. At daybreak the council of the elders ... met

When Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he was seized with remorse and returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and the elders. "I have sinned," he said, "for I have betrayed innocent blood.What is that to us?" they replied. "That's your responsibility." So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself. The chief priests picked up the coins and said, "It is against the law to put this into the treasury, since it is blood money." So they decided to use the money to buy the potter's field as a burial place for foreigners. That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day. Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: "They took the thirty silver coins, the price set on him by the people of Israel, and they used them to buy the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me."

– The story of how Jesus was executed has a lot in common with the modern version of the Bible, but it's a little different this time around. In the Gospel of Matthew, the Jews led Jesus to the palace of the Roman governor, where he was accused of being a traitor to the nation and sentenced to death. The Jews refused to execute him because they didn't want to unclean up the palace for Passover, so he was taken to the governor's office. When the governor asked him what charges he was bringing against him, the Jewish leaders replied, "If he were not a criminal, we would not have handed him over to you." The governor said, "Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law." The Jews objected. "But we have no right to execute anyone," they said. This happened so that the words Jesus had spoken indicating the kind of death he was going to die would be fulfilled. Read the full Gospel here.

– It's a story that's been told before, but it's getting new attention thanks to an account in Sunday's New York Times Magazine. As the story goes, Jesus was about to be arrested on charges of being a king of the Jews, but instead of answering the governor's question, he simply said, "I am the king." That set off a series of events that led Pilate to question him, to which he replied, "My kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jews. But now my kingdom is from another place." "You are right in saying I am a king," Pilate replied. "In fact, for this reason I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me." He went on to say, "What is truth?" Jesus' reply: "I find no basis for a charge against him." Click for the full account.

But they insisted, "He stirs up the people all over Judea by his teaching. He started in Galilee and has come all the way here." On hearing this, Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean. When he learned that Jesus was under Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time. When Herod saw Jesus, he was greatly pleased, because for a long time he had been wanting to see him. From what he had heard about him, he hoped to see him perform some miracle. He plied him with many questions, but Jesus gave him no answer. The chief priests and the teachers of the law were standing there, vehemently accusing him. Then Herod and his soldiers ridiculed and mocked him. Dressing him in an elegant robe, they sent him back to Pilate. That day Herod and Pilate became friends--before this they had been enemies.

While Pilate was sitting on the judge's seat, his wife sent him this message: "Don't have anything to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him."

Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers and the people, and said to them, "You brought me this man as one who was inciting the people to rebellion. I have examined him in your presence and have found no basis for your charges against him. Neither has Herod, for he sent him back to us; as you can see, he has done nothing to deserve death. Therefore, I will punish him and then release him."

– The story of how Jesus was released from prison—and why it's so controversial—is getting a lot of attention this week, thanks in part to a New York Times op-ed by an ex-journalist. In it, Michael Winship recounts the story of Pilate, who was asked by the crowd at the time, "Which one do you want me to release to you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?" The crowd's answer was "Barabbas," and Pilate knew it was out of envy that they had given Jesus to them. "But it is your custom for me to Release to You One prisoner at the Time of the Passover," he wrote. "Do you want Me to Release 'The King of the Jews'?" Winship's take: "It's not a stretch to say that this is the most controversial story of the week, and the most important story of all." Read it in full here.

– The story of Jesus' crucifixion is a grim one, but it's one that's been told before. In the Gospel of John, the crowd gathered around Jesus as he was about to be put to death, and the governor asked, "Which of the two do you want me to release to you?" The crowd answered, "Barabbas." Barabbas was a figure in the crowd who had taken part in a rebellion, so the crowd persuaded Pilate to release him rather than execute Jesus. The crowd cried, "Away with this man!" But the governor refused, and Jesus was executed. The New York Times has a fascinating look at the story, noting that the crowd's ultimate goal was to get Jesus' younger brother, Matthew, released from prison, and that the older Matthew was the one to ask for the younger Jesus' release.

– The story of how Jesus was crucified continues to resonate today, in part because of the Roman Catholic Church's opposition to the idea. Here's a look at some of the key quotes from the account in the New York Times: The crowd: "What shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called Christ?" Pilate asked. They all answered, "Crucify him!" "Why? What crime has he committed?" Pilate said. "But they shouted all the louder, 'Crucified him!'" Wanting to release Jesus, Pilate appealed to them again. But they kept shouting, "'Crucification him! Crucify he!" For the third time he spoke to them: "Why?" What crime had he committed? I have found in him no grounds for the death penalty. Therefore I will have him punished and then release him." The crowd's shouts: "They insistently demanded that he be crucified, and their shouts prevailed." The King of the Jews: They shouted, "Whatshall I do ... with the one you call the king of the Jewish people?" Pilate told them. "CruCify him! Why? Whatcrime has he commited?" The crowd answered: "He is a thief."

– The story of Jesus' death and resurrection is well-known, but it's been a while since anyone paid much attention to the details. That changed this week, however, with the release of the Gospel of John. Here's what you need to know: The account: It's based on the New International Version of the Bible, which the Wall Street Journal points out is "by far the most widely read version of the book." The original version tells of soldiers who led Jesus into a palace and mocked him. "They spit on him, and took the staff and struck him on the head again and again." The soldiers then called out to him, "Hail, king of the Jews!" and repeatedly hit him with a staff. The soldiers fell on their knees and paid homage to him. Pilate then had him flogged. "The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They clothed him in a purple robe and went up to him again and once, saying, 'Hail, King of theJews!' And they struck him in the face." The Journal has the full text here.

Once more Pilate came out and said to the Jews, "Look, I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against him." When Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate said to them, "Here is the man!" As soon as the chief priests and their officials saw him, they shouted, "Crucify! Crucify!" But Pilate answered, "You take him and crucify him. As for me, I find no basis for a charge against him." The Jews insisted, "We have a law, and according to that law he must die, because he claimed to be the Son of God." When Pilate heard this, he was even more afraid, and he went back inside the palace. "Where do you come from?" he asked Jesus, but Jesus gave him no answer. "Do you refuse to speak to me?" Pilate said. "Don't you realize I have power either to free you or to crucify you?" Jesus answered, "You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin." From then on, Pilate tried to set Jesus free, but the Jews kept shouting, "If you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar." When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge's seat at a place known as the Stone Pavement (which in Aramaic is Gabbatha). It was the day of Preparation of Passover Week, about the sixth hour. "Here is your king," Pilate said to the Jews. But they shouted, "Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him!Shall I crucify your king?" Pilate asked. "We have no king but Caesar," the chief priests answered.

When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. "I am innocent of this man's blood," he said. "It is your responsibility!" All the people answered, "Let his blood be on us and on our children!"

– In the Gospel of John, Jesus is said to have been taken from his mother's hand and thrown to the ground by a crowd. He was then beaten and gagged, and when the crowd demanded he be crucified, he was given over to them to be done with it. In other words, it's the story of John's death and resurrection that's getting the most attention, but there's a lot more to it, too, reports the Los Angeles Times. The first account of the story is from the Book of Isaiah, and it tells of the crowd that gathered around the well where Jesus was to be crucified: "And they said to him, 'We want you, our God, to be hanged; we want you to be put to death.' And he said to them, 'My God, whoever wants to come to me will be hanged.' So they hanged him, and they took his body and they put it in the well, and the well was filled with wine." The crowd believed that the well had been paid for by God, and that Jesus would be hanged there. The Gospel of Luke, meanwhile, tells of a group of people who wanted to know why Jesus had not been taken to the well

– It's a story that's been told before, but it's getting new attention thanks to a New York Times Magazine cover story. The cover story, which first appeared in the Times Magazine's September issue, tells the story of a young Jesus who was mocked by a group of monks—and then crucifyd by soldiers. "After they had mocked him, they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him," the story begins. "Then they led him away to crucifying him. So the soldiers took charge of Jesus. ... carrying his own cross, he went out to the place of the Skull (which in Aramaic is called Golgotha)." The Times says the story was inspired by a letter from a German prince to Jesus, who was visiting from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The prince had been angered by the monks' treatment of Jesus, so he wrote to the monks: "I will send you one of my own sons to do the work of yours." The monks agreed, and the young Jesus was led to a spot where he was crucified.

– The story of how Jesus carried the cross—and how it was made for a man who didn't carry it—is a fascinating one, and it's one that's been told before. The New York Times revisits it in its latest Bible study, and this time the story is told from the perspective of the disciples who encountered it. They were on their way out to see Jesus when they met a man named Simon, who was traveling from the country. As they led him away, they seized him, put the cross on him, and made him carry it behind Jesus. The story is based on the book of Matthew.

A large number of people followed him, including women who mourned and wailed for him. Jesus turned and said to them, "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; weep for yourselves and for your children. For the time will come when you will say, 'Blessed are the barren women, the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!' Then "'they will say to the mountains, "Fall on us!" and to the hills, "Cover us!"' For if men do these things when the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?"

– When it comes to the Catholic Church, the "here" and "now" are conflated, and the "what" part is getting lost in all the confusion. The New York Times revisits the story of Jesus Christ's crucifixion and death in the second half of the 20th century, and finds that the church has made major strides in recent years. Among other things, it now emphasizes that Jesus was a "true priest," not a follower, and that those who believe in him are more likely to be faithful than those who don't. (The Times notes that the early church was made up mostly of men.) In other words, it's a more diverse church than it was a few years ago, and its members are more diverse than ever before. But that doesn't mean the church isn't trying to appeal to today's secular world, which is looking for "authenticity," says its president. "We're trying to draw more people into the faith," says Rev. Robert Maranto. "It's not about making them Catholic. It's about drawing them in."

Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing." And they divided up his clothes by casting lots.

– When Jesus was put to death on the cross, the soldiers who were watching over him took his clothes and divided them into four shares, one for each of them, with the undergarment remaining. "Let's not tear it," they said to one another. " Let's decide by lot who will get it." The soldiers then cast lots to see who would get the garment, which was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom. "They divided my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing," said the scripture.

It was the third hour when they crucified him.

– "What I have written, I have wrote." That's how Pontius Pilate, the Pilate who oversaw the execution of Jesus, responded when Jews protested that he should not write "The King of the Jews" on the cross. "Do not write 'The Kingof the Jews,' but that this man claimed to be king of the Jewish people," the Jews' chief priests told him. Pilate replied, "I have written." But the Jews didn't stop there. After the crucifixion, they placed a notice above Jesus' head reading, "This is Jesus, the KING of the JEWS." Many Jews read the sign, which was written in Aramaic, Latin, and Greek. Pilate had a notice prepared and fastened to the cross, which read, "Jesus of NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS. Many of theJews read this sign, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city." The chief priests protested to Pilate, but he responded, "What we have written is the word of God. What I have writing is what I have done."

– The Vatican's ambassador to the United States has been ordered to appear before a Senate panel to answer questions about the "death penalty" in the US and whether it's still being practiced there, the AP reports. The panel will be looking into whether the death penalty is still being enforced in the country, and whether any laws have been broken. The Senate Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing on the issue on Tuesday. The AP notes that in the 1980s, the US Supreme Court ruled that the government had the authority to execute criminals.

– The story of Jesus Christ's death and resurrection is a well-known one, but it's been a little under-reported—until now. In the Gospel of John, Jesus is said to have been resurrected from the dead on the third day after his crucifixion. The New York Times has a nice explainer of the story, but here's what it says: "It is said that after he had been resurrected, he was taken up into the kingdom of God, and he was given the name 'Son of God.'" (In other words, the Bible says he is the son of God.) As for why the story is so well-remembered, the Times explains that it comes from the Book of Isaiah, which says, "And God said to the people, 'Elijah, my son, you who are going to destroy the temple, and build it in three days, come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!'" (Read the story in full here.) It's not clear how the story got this far, but the Times says it came from "a book written in the sixth century by a Jewish scholar who was a close friend of Jesus' mother, Mary Magdalene. The scholar

The soldiers also came up and mocked him. They offered him wine vinegar and said, "If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself."

One of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him: "Aren't you the Christ? Save yourself and us!" But the other criminal rebuked him. "Don't you fear God," he said, "since you are under the same sentence? We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong." Then he said, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom. " Jesus answered him, "I tell you the truth, today you will be with me in paradise."

Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus saw his mother there, and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, "Dear woman, here is your son," and to the disciple, "Here is your mother." From that time on, this disciple took her into his home.

– It's not every day you get the chance to go to the movies with your kids, but that's exactly what happens when your kids are little. That's why it's so important for parents to make sure their kids are familiar with the basics—like, say, how to drive a car and how to read a book—before they let them off the hook, reports the Los Angeles Times. That way, when the kids get older, they won't be tempted to do things like drive drunk or get in trouble. "It's important for the kids to understand what it means to be a responsible parent," says the president of the American Academy of Pediatrics. "They're not going to grow up and say, 'I made a mistake.' They're going to have to figure that out themselves."

– The story of Jesus Christ's final hours is told in the Gospel of John, and it's a tale of death and resurrection that's getting a lot of attention. Here's what you need to know: The first part of the story is fairly straightforward: "About the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, 'Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?' which means, 'My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?' When some of those standing there heard this, they said, 'He's calling Elijah.'" The second part is a bit more complicated: "And at the 9th hour Jesus yelled in a large voice, "Eloi ... lama bachtani?" (which means, "My God ... why have You forsaken me?") Some of those near him heard the voice and said, "Listen, he's called Elijah." The third part is fairly dramatic: "Then Jesus said to them, 'Elijah, who am I to call?' And they said to him, 'Son of Man, what do you want me to do?' and he answered, 'I am the son of God.' And he said to the crowd,

– It's a tale of thirsty Jesus, retold in the Gospel of John, and it involves a jar of wine vinegar. When Jesus was about to drink from it, one of the men in the crowd offered him a sponge filled with wine vinegar, and Jesus said, "I am thirsty." The men soaked the sponge in the vinegar, put it on a stalk of the hyssop plant, and lifted it to Jesus' lips.

– "Now leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to take him down." That was one of the lines from the Bible's King David to Solomon in the Gospel of Solomon, according to the New York Daily News. It's a line that Solomon's son, Solomon III, is believed to have uttered during a battle with the Philistines in the sixth century CE. The battle was said to have left Solomon dead and buried, and the Philistines then took his body and threw it into the sea. The king's message to Solomon, however, was not to bury the body, but to use it to save his people. The Philistines then threw it back down the sea, where it rested for a while before being retrieved by the pharaoh's soldiers. The pharaoh then gave the soldiers the keys to his tomb and told them to keep the body and the keys, and they did just that. The soldiers then took the keys back and returned the body to the pharaoh, who in turn gave it back to the soldiers, who then took it back again and gave it to the Philistines again. (Solomon's death was followed by the Battle of Thermopylae, in which the Philistines killed the pharaoh and his soldiers.)

When he had received the drink, Jesus said, "It is finished." With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.

Jesus called out with a loud voice, "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit." When he had said this, he breathed his last.

– The story of Jesus' final days is told in the Gospel of John, and it's not a happy one. In the book's opening chapter, Jesus says, "And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit. With a loud cry, Jesus breathed his last." (John 12: 29-30) The story goes on to say that when the disciples heard Jesus' last words, they thought, "Oh Lord, this is a thief in the making." But when Jesus got back on his feet, they realized he was no longer a thief. He was, in fact, "a God-fearing man." The disciples believed that Jesus had been killed by an assassin, but when they got to the tomb, they found a body with a bullet through it. The killers had been on the loose for some time, and the disciples thought they had found a way to get away. But when they went into the room where the body had been found, they were surprised to find it was empty. They found no one who had been able to escape the killers. "And God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in him may not perish but have eternal life."

– The story of how Jesus was resurrected—and the people who came after him—is a fascinating one, and one that's been told before, but it's getting new attention thanks to this New York Times Magazine article. The piece focuses on the disciples' interactions with Jesus before and after his resurrection, and it includes this line: "And the crowd shouted, 'Repent! Repent!'" (It's a play on the crowd-funding site Kickstarter's call for Jesus to be re-baptized.) The article's description of the scene: "At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook and the rocks split. The tombs broke open and the bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life. They came out of the tombs, and after Jesus' resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many people." It's not the first time the Times has covered this story, but this time it focuses on one of the most famous disciples.

– When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified, and exclaimed, "Surely he was the Son of God!" And when the centurion, who stood there in front of Jesus, heard his cry and saw how he died, he said: "Surely this man was the son of God! The centurion, seeing what had happened ... praised God and said, 'Surely this was a righteous man.'" The Bible's account of the centurion's words is based on the Gospel of John, which says, "Then the Lord said to them, 'This is my son,'" and the people in the crowd shouted, "He is the Son ... of God." The crowd believed so strongly that Jesus took the mic and said to the crowd, "My God, this is your son!" The centurion then stood there and heard Jesus' cry, and the crowd believed him. When the earthquake struck, the centurion saw how Jesus had died, and he said to himself, "This is the son ... Surely he was ... the Son."

When all the people who had gathered to witness this sight saw what took place, they beat their breasts and went away.

– The Vatican's ambassador to the United Nations has issued a blunt warning to world leaders: If they don't get serious about climate change, they're going to pay a heavy price. In an open letter to Ban Ki-moon, Cardinal Donald Wuerl warns that if they fail to do so, "the credibility of the international community" will be damaged, the AP reports. "The credibility of our own credibility is at stake," he writes. "We cannot afford to lose our credibility as a people if we fail to act." The letter comes a day after the UN announced that it will hold an emergency meeting next month to decide how to deal with the effects of climate change. It's not the first time the ambassador has made such a statement, notes the AP: In a speech to the UN General Assembly last year, he warned that inaction on climate change would be a "grave mistake" that would be "self-destructive."

Now it was the day of Preparation, and the next day was to be a special Sabbath. Because the Jews did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the Sabbath, they asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down. The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus, and then those of the other. But when they came to Jesus and found that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. Instead, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus' side with a spear, bringing a sudden flow of blood and water. The man who saw it has given testimony, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, and he testifies so that you also may believe. These things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled: "Not one of his bones will be broken," and, as another scripture says, "They will look on the one they have pierced."

– The story of how Jesus was executed—and the man who took his body—is a fascinating one, and it's a story that's getting a lot of attention in the wake of the Orlando shooting. The New York Times revisits the story in its latest issue, and in its lead, it recounts how a wealthy man from the Judean town of Arimathea went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. When Pilate was told the man was already dead, he gave the body to the man, identified as Joseph. Joseph was a disciple of Jesus, but he feared the Jews, so he made a secret visit to Pilate to ask for the body. With Pilate's permission, he took it away. The Times explains that the story is based on an account in the book of Leviticus, in which a man named David goes to the well of the Sea of Galilee and retrieves the body of a man who has been dead for three days. The body is then returned to David, who says, "I will make you my son." The Times notes that the king of Israel at the time didn't approve of David's move, and the king had to sign off on it.

– When Jesus was laid to rest, he was wrapped in linen strips wrapped in spices. The story of his burial, as told in the Gospel of John, is a fascinating one, but it's far from the only one. Here's what you need to know: The story is based on the account of Joseph, Jesus' uncle, who was in charge of the tomb where Jesus was crucified. Joseph had his own tomb cut out of the rock in front of the one where he had been crucified. So he bought some linen cloth and wrapped Jesus' body in it. He then rolled a stone against the entrance to the tomb and went away. Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out the rock. He rolled a big stone in back of the entrance and went off. So Joseph bought some Linen Cloth and wrapped the Body of Jesus in It. Then he rolled a Stone against the Entrance to the Tomb and placed It in a Tomb Cut Out of Rock. Then He Took It Down, Wrapped It in linen Cloth and Place It in A tomb cut Out of rock. And Then He Rolled a Stone Against the entrance of the Tomb. So This was the Jewish

– The story of how Mary Magdalene and Mary's mother, Mary the mother of Joses, came to see Jesus' tomb is a fascinating one, and one that's just now coming to light thanks to a BBC documentary. The short film tells the story of the Magdalenes' visit to the site of the tomb where Jesus was laid to rest, and how they followed Joseph, the man who had taken them with him to Galilee, to the spot where his body was laid. The BBC's description of the story: "The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed Joseph and saw the tomb and how he was laid in it. They were accompanied by Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, who was sitting there opposite the tomb." The story is told in the second half of the two-part BBC documentary, The Magdalenes: The Real Story of Mary Magdalene's Visit to the Tomb of Jesus.

Then they went home and prepared spices and perfumes. But they rested on the Sabbath in obedience to the commandment.

The next day, the one after Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate. "Sir," they said, "we remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said, 'After three days I will rise again.' So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day. Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead. This last deception will be worse than the first." "Take a guard," Pilate answered. "Go, make the tomb as secure as you know how." So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard.

When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices so that they might go to anoint Jesus' body.

– The story of Mary Magdalene, the wife of Jesus Christ, is a fascinating one, and it's been told before—including in the Bible. But a new documentary airing on ABC's This Week with George Stephanopoulos takes it to a whole new level. The film focuses on how Mary Magdalene was portrayed in the Gospel of John, in which she's described as "one of the most important figures in the history of Christianity." The premise of the documentary is that in the days before Jesus' death, Mary Magdalene and a friend went to the tomb of her husband's best friend, John the Baptist, to ask who would roll the stone that would remove the tomb's entrance. The stone was eventually removed, but not before Mary Magdalene had seen it taken away. The new documentary explores how that happened, as well as how the story of John's death has been re-envisioned.

There was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and, going to the tomb, rolled back the stone and sat on it. His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow. The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men.

– It's a story straight out of a spy thriller, but this one involves an Egyptian prince and a stone. The story goes that Prince Abdelhamid bin Abdellatif al-Sisi, leader of the country's Arab Spring movement, visited the tomb of King Herod's father, Herod the Great, and discovered that a large stone had been rolled away from the tomb, reports the Telegraph. The tomb had been dug up a few years ago, and the stone was said to be more than a foot high. But when the prince went to check on it, he found that it was missing a large portion of top and bottom.

but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.

– It's the story of a pair of ancient Egyptian scholars who stumbled across a set of clues that led them to the tomb of David, one of the most important figures in Egyptian history, reports the Los Angeles Times. In the book David and Goliath: The Battle of the Great Pyramids of Giza, they recount how they stumbled across the tomb, which had been dug by David's father, King David I, some 2,000 years ago. The tomb's entrance had been blocked by a bronze barrier, but the scholars stumbled across two sets of clues—one on the right and one on the left—that led them back to David. They were led to David, who had been buried in the same cemetery as David, and they discovered that he had been killed in a battle between the Egyptians and the Babylonians more than 2,000 years earlier. David was believed to have been killed by a group of monks who had taken control of the tomb after David I'd been buried. The scholars say that when they confronted the monks with the clues, they were surprised to find that many of them had no idea who David was. "I don't know who David is, but I do know that he was a king," one of them tells the Times.

– It's the story of a group of women looking for Jesus and an angel reassuring them that he's not there. The account comes from the Gospel of John, and it's one of the best-known stories in the book, notes the Los Angeles Times. In it, the women go to the well where Jesus was laid to rest after his crucifixion, and the angel there reassures them: "He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay." The women bowed down in fright, but the men in the room reassured them. "Why do you look for the living among the dead?" they asked. He is not there."

he has risen! Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee: 'The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.'" Then they remembered his words.

– The New York Times is out with a correction to a story about Jesus that first appeared in Sunday's newspaper. In the original version of the story, which was based on a letter from the Rev. John Paul II to his followers, the evangelist was quoted as saying, "He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him." The Times has now corrected that to say he is going "ahead of you" into Galilee "just as he told you." (Read the original story in full here.)

Trembling and bewildered, the women went out and fled from the tomb. They said nothing to anyone, because they were afraid.

So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples.

So she came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved, and said, "They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know where they have put him!"

– The story of how Jesus' followers came to believe that he had risen from the dead has been well-documented, but the New York Times takes it to a whole new level in its analysis of the Gospel of John. In the first part of the story, the disciples go to the tomb, and the story goes like this: "Peter, one of them, got up and ran to the Tomb. Bending over, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he went away, wondering to himself what had happened. So Peter and the other disciple started for the tomb." The other disciple reached the tomb first, and then Simon Peter went into the tomb. He saw the burial cloth that had been around Jesus' head, as well as the linen strips lying there. Finally, he went inside and saw and believed. (They still did not understand from Scripture that Jesus had to rise from thedead.) Then the disciples went back to their homes, the Times notes. The account of the disciples' journey is told in three parts, the first in the gospels of Matthew, Luke, and John and the second in the New International Version. The Times says it's the first time the story of Jesus' disciples has been told in this

– The story of Jesus' first day on the planet is a fascinating one, and the New York Times today takes a look at how it's been told over the centuries. It begins when Mary Magdalene went to the tomb after her husband's death. She was crying, and she saw two angels. "They have taken my Lord away," she said, "and I don't know where they have put him." She turned around and saw Jesus standing there. "Why are you crying?" he asked. "Who is it you are looking for?" She thought he was the gardener, but he said to her, "Mary, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have placed him, and I will get him." As she turned toward him, she cried out in Aramaic, "Rabboni!" (which means teacher). Jesus said, “Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet returned to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, 'I am returning to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'" The Times explains that the story is based on the Gospel of John, which says that when Jesus was about to enter the tomb, a crowd of people began to gather around

Suddenly Jesus met them. "Greetings," he said. They came to him, clasped his feet and worshiped him. Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me."

While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened. When the chief priests had met with the elders and devised a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money, telling them, "You are to say, 'His disciples came during the night and stole him away while we were asleep.' If this report gets to the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble." So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. And this story has been widely circulated among the Jews to this very day.

– When Mary Magdalene went to the disciples to tell them that Jesus had seen her, they didn't believe her. But when they heard that he had been alive and that she had seen him, they did not believe it. When they came back from the tomb, they told all these things to the Eleven and to all the others. It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the others with them who told this to the apostles. But they didn’t believe the women, because their words seemed to them like nonsense. Mary Magdalene going to the Disciples with the news: “I have seen the Lord!” And she told them that he’d said these Things to her.

and saying, "It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon."

– It's the story of a group of people who were "talking with each other about everything that had happened" when Jesus appeared to them and asked, "What are you discussing together as you walk along?" They stood still, their faces downcast. He asked them, "Are you only a visitor to Jerusalem and do not know the things that have happened there in these days?" They replied. "About Jesus of Nazareth," they said. "He was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people. The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified him; but we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. And what is more, it is the third day since all this took place. ... Some of our women amazed us. They went to the tomb early this morning but didn't find his body. They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels, who said he was alive. Then some of our companions went to ... the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see." "He said to them, 'How foolish you are, and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets

As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus acted as if he were going farther. But they urged him strongly, "Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is almost over." So he went in to stay with them. When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them. Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight. They asked each other, "Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?"

– The story of the disciples' encounter with Jesus is well-known, but what's less well known is how the disciples reacted when they heard that the son of God had risen from the dead. The New York Times today takes a look at what happened next, and it's not pretty: The disciples were on their way back to Jerusalem from the Mideast when they encountered a group of men who had heard about the coming of the Messiah. One of the men said to them, "The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon." The disciples didn't believe him at first, but then they heard a loud voice say, "Simon, the Lord is risen!" The men recognized the voice as that of Jesus, who had just broken their bread. They ran to him and shouted, "He is the Lord! He is the God of my God! He has risen! The Lord is my God!" The disciples left the men behind and returned to Jerusalem at once. They found the Eleven and those with them, assembled together and saying, "It is true!" Then the two told what had happened on the way, and how Jesus was recognized by them when he broke the bread. Read the full story here.

– The story of Jesus' first week as head of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints gets stranger. As the Salt Lake Tribune reports, the story goes like this: On the first day of the week, when the disciples were together, with the doors locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, "Peace be with you!" After he said this, he showed them his hands and side. The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord. They gave him a piece of broiled fish, and he ate it in their presence.

Again Jesus said, "Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I am sending you." And with that he breathed on them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive anyone his sins, they are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven."

He said to them, "This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms." Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures. He told them, "This is what is written: The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day, and repentance and forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things.
