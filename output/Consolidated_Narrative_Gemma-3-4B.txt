Six days before the Passover, Jesus arrived at Bethany, where Lazarus resided, and was hosted for a dinner. While reclining at the table with Lazarus, a woman, identified as Mary, entered the home of Simon the Leper. She brought an alabaster jar containing a pint of pure, expensive nard – a fragrant perfume – and poured it upon Jesus’ feet, then wiping them with her hair.  Some of the disciples, including Judas Iscariot, reacted with indignation, questioning the extravagance and suggesting the money could have been given to the poor.  Judas, motivated by his own greed as the keeper of the funds, argued vehemently against the act. However, Jesus rebuked the disciples, praising Mary’s generous and thoughtful gesture, stating that while poverty would always exist, he would not. He affirmed that Mary’s act, a preparation for his burial, would be remembered and recounted throughout the world as a testament to her devotion.

Meanwhile a large crowd of Jews found out that Jesus was there and came, not only because of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus as well, for on account of him many of the Jews were going over to Jesus and putting their faith in him.

The next day the great crowd that had come for the Feast heard that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. They took palm branches and went out to meet him, shouting, "Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!Blessed is the King of Israel!"

As Jesus approached Jerusalem and arrived at Bethphage and Bethany on the Mount of Olives, he dispatched two of his disciples to secure a suitable mount of transport. Following his instructions, the disciples entered the village ahead and discovered a young, untried colt tied at a doorway. They untied it and brought it to Jesus, who then settled upon it, draping their cloaks over the animal as a makeshift seat. Initially, the disciples didn’t fully grasp the significance of this event, referencing the prophecy of Zechariah – “See, your king comes to you, gentle and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.” It wasn’t until later, after Jesus’s resurrection and glorification, that they understood the fulfillment of this prophecy and the deliberate nature of their actions.

As Jesus journeyed along the road, a massive crowd enthusiastically welcomed him. Many spread their cloaks and branches – some cut from trees, others from fields – on the path, creating a festive display. Those preceding and following Jesus shouted praises, proclaiming “Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!” and declaring the “Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David!” As Jesus approached the descent of the Mount of Olives, the entire group of disciples erupted in joyful praise, recounting the miracles they had witnessed and proclaiming, “Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!” However, some Pharisees within the crowd urged Jesus to silence his followers, to which he responded with a powerful warning, stating that “if they keep quiet, the stones will cry out.”

As he approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it and said, "If you, even you, had only known on this day what would bring you peace--but now it is hidden from your eyes. The days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you and encircle you and hem you in on every side. They will dash you to the ground, you and the children within your walls. They will not leave one stone on another, because you did not recognize the time of God's coming to you."

As Jesus entered Jerusalem, a wave of excitement and questioning swept through the city, with the crowds proclaiming, “This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee.” This wasn’t a spontaneous reaction; it followed a recent surge of belief sparked by the miraculous resurrection of Lazarus, an event that had been widely publicized by those who had witnessed it. Because of this astonishing display of power, many people eagerly traveled to meet him upon his arrival, fueling the growing momentum behind his movement.  The Pharisees, observing this widespread adoration and the growing number of followers, expressed their concern, stating, “See, this is getting us nowhere. Look how the whole world has gone after him!”


Jesus entered Jerusalem and proceeded to the temple, spending some time observing everything within. As it grew late, he departed Jerusalem with the Twelve disciples and headed to Bethany, where he spent the night before continuing his journey.

The following day, as Jesus and his disciples were leaving Bethany, Jesus felt a pang of hunger. In the distance, he spotted a fig tree laden with leaves. He eagerly approached, hoping for fruit, but found only foliage – it was simply not the season for figs. Disappointed, he angrily cursed the tree, declaring that no one should ever eat from it again, and his disciples heard his words. This occurred as he was returning towards the city, having been hungry earlier that morning on his way back.

Upon arriving in Jerusalem, Jesus entered the temple area and immediately began to confront the commercial activity taking place within. He drove out those buying and selling, overturning the tables of the money changers and the benches used by those selling doves.  He repeatedly declared, “It is written: ‘My house will be called a house of prayer,’ but you are making it ‘a den of robbers.’”  This action, described across multiple accounts, underscored his belief that the temple was being corrupted and transformed into a place of commerce rather than worship, a sentiment powerfully expressed in his citation of scripture.

As Jesus continued to teach daily at the temple, attracting a growing crowd who were amazed by his words, the chief priests and teachers of the law became increasingly desperate to silence him. They recognized his growing influence and feared the potential disruption to their authority, and began actively seeking a way to kill him. Despite their efforts to find a means to eliminate him, they were consistently thwarted by the unwavering devotion of the people, who hung on every word he spoke, making any attempt at assassination impossible.

The blind and the lame came to him at the temple, and he healed them. But when the chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did and the children shouting in the temple area, "Hosanna to the Son of David," they were indignant. "Do you hear what these children are saying?" they asked him. "Yes," replied Jesus, "have you never read, "'From the lips of children and infants you have ordained praise'?"

When evening came, they went out of the city.

Each day Jesus was teaching at the temple, and each evening he went out to spend the night on the hill called the Mount of Olives, and all the people came early in the morning to hear him at the temple.

As Jesus and his disciples traveled along, they encountered a withered fig tree, completely lifeless from the roots. Immediately upon witnessing this, Jesus declared, “May you never bear fruit again!” and the tree instantly withered. Astonished, the disciples questioned, “How did the fig tree wither so quickly?” Jesus then explained his power, stating that with faith and without doubt, they too could perform similar miracles, even commanding mountains to move. He emphasized the importance of belief, stating, “If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer,” and further instructed them to “have faith in God,” reinforcing the idea that those who truly believe and don’t doubt will see their requests fulfilled. He concluded with a reminder to forgive others, stating, “Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.”

As Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, the chief priests, elders, and teachers of the law approached him, demanding to know by what authority he was performing his miracles. They questioned him repeatedly, asking, “By what authority are you doing these things? And who gave you this authority?” Jesus responded with a single question: “John’s baptism—was it from heaven, or from men?” The religious leaders deliberated amongst themselves, recognizing the public’s belief in John’s prophetic status and fearing the consequences if they admitted John’s baptism stemmed from divine origins, as it would challenge their own authority.  They admitted they didn’t know, and Jesus, without revealing his own authority, simply stated, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.”

"What do you think? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first and said, 'Son, go and work today in the vineyard.' "'I will not,' he answered, but later he changed his mind and went. "Then the father went to the other son and said the same thing. He answered, 'I will, sir,' but he did not go. "Which of the two did what his father wanted?The first," they answered. Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you. For John came to you to show you the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did. And even after you saw this, you did not repent and believe him.

Jesus began to teach using parables, starting with the story of a landowner who meticulously invested in a vineyard – building a wall, a winepress, and a watchtower before renting it to some farmers and departing on a long journey. At harvest time, he repeatedly sent servants to collect his due, but each time the tenants violently resisted, beating, killing, and ultimately murdering the servants.  Undeterred, the landowner sent his son, whom he deeply loved, hoping for respect. However, upon seeing the son, the tenants plotted and killed him, throwing him out of the vineyard.  Faced with this horrific outcome, the listeners asked, “What then will the owner of the vineyard do?” The response was chilling: “He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others.”

Jesus, addressing his disciples, quoted a passage from the Old Testament scripture: “‘The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes.’” He then elaborated, stating that the kingdom of God would be transferred to a different people, those who would “produce its fruit.”  Using this scripture as a foundation, Jesus warned them that anyone who fell upon this “stone” – representing the previously rejected Messiah – would be “broken to pieces,” while those upon whom it fell would be “crushed.” He looked directly at his disciples as he spoke, emphasizing the significance of the prophecy.

As Jesus spoke his parables, the chief priests and Pharisees quickly realized he was directly addressing them and sought a means to arrest him. Driven by this knowledge and their fear of the large, supportive crowd who believed him to be a prophet, they attempted to escape, ultimately leaving him and retreating from the situation. The teachers of the law, mirroring this urgency, also immediately sought to apprehend Jesus, recognizing his words as a condemnation of their actions, but were similarly deterred by the people’s unwavering faith and fear of public unrest.

Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying: "The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son. He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the banquet to tell them to come, but they refused to come. "Then he sent some more servants and said, 'Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner: My oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.' "But they paid no attention and went off--one to his field, another to his business. The rest seized his servants, mistreated them and killed them. The king was enraged. He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city. "Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding banquet is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come. Go to the street corners and invite to the banquet anyone you find.' So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad, and the wedding hall was filled with guests. "But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes. 'Friend,' he asked, 'how did you get in here without wedding clothes?' The man was speechless. "Then the king told the attendants, 'Tie him hand and foot, and throw him outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.' "For many are invited, but few are chosen."

Driven by a desire to trap Jesus and hand him over to the Roman authorities, the Pharisees and Herodians, disguised as honest observers, repeatedly questioned him about paying taxes to Caesar. They acknowledged his integrity and his adherence to the truth, posing the question of whether it was right to pay taxes. Recognizing their manipulative intent, Jesus immediately challenged them, demanding to see a denarius. When presented with the coin, he inquired about its portrait and inscription, prompting the disciples to identify it as bearing Caesar’s image.  Responding with his famous dictum, “Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s,” Jesus exposed their deception, leaving them utterly astonished and speechless by his wisdom and insight.

On one particular day, the Sadducees, who denied the resurrection, approached Jesus with a perplexing question. They presented a hypothetical scenario: seven brothers had each successively married the same widow, and all seven had died without producing any children. Now, that widow had also passed away. The Sadducees then inquired, “At the resurrection, whose wife will she be of the seven?” Jesus responded, correcting their misunderstanding, stating they were mistaken due to their lack of knowledge of Scripture and God’s power. He explained that at the resurrection, neither marriage nor being married would exist, and individuals would be like the angels in heaven. Referencing God’s declaration to Moses – “I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob” – he emphasized that God’s concern was for the living, not the dead, and that the concept of resurrection was indeed established, as evidenced by Moses’ account of the burning bush. The crowds were astonished by Jesus’ teaching.

Following reports that Jesus had successfully silenced the Sadducees, a group of Pharisees, including an expert in the Law, gathered to question him. The expert approached Jesus and, impressed by his answer, posed the central question: “Which is the greatest commandment in the Law?” Jesus responded with the foundational principle: “Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.” He then declared that the second great commandment was to “love your neighbor as yourself,” stating that all the Law and the Prophets hinged upon these two commands. A teacher of the law, recognizing the wisdom of Jesus’s response, affirmed his truthfulness about God’s oneness and the paramount importance of loving Him with all one’s being and loving one’s neighbor, even surpassing the significance of religious rituals like burnt offerings.  Upon hearing this, Jesus commended the man, stating he was “not far from the kingdom of God,” and from that point forward, no one dared to question him further.

While teaching in the temple courts, Jesus questioned the Pharisees about their understanding of the Christ’s identity, specifically asking, “How is it that the teachers of the law say the Christ is the son of David?” He then quoted from Psalm 109, referencing David’s words spoken “by the Holy Spirit”: “‘The Lord said to my Lord: “Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet.’” Jesus pressed the point, asking, “How then can he be his son?”  He repeated the question while the Pharisees were gathered, emphasizing the same passage, and noting David’s direct address of the Christ as “Lord.”  No one was able to offer a response, and from that day forward, the Pharisees ceased to question him directly.

As Jesus taught the crowds and his disciples, he cautioned them to obey the teachers of the law and the Pharisees, recognizing their position “in Moses’ seat,” but warned against imitating their superficial piety. He observed that these men, often adorned in flowing robes and eager for public recognition – greeting people in the marketplaces, securing the most prominent seats in synagogues and banquets, and demanding to be called “Rabbi” – prioritized outward appearances over genuine righteousness. Jesus specifically criticized their hypocrisy, noting they “devoured widows’ houses” and engaged in lengthy, ostentatious prayers, ultimately predicting that such individuals would face severe punishment. He then reiterated his core teachings, emphasizing humility and service, stating that the greatest among them would be their servant and urging his followers not to call anyone “father” or “teacher,” but to recognize their shared connection to the one Father and the one Teacher, the Christ.

"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut the kingdom of heaven in men's faces. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those enter who are trying to. See Footnote "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of hell as you are. "Woe to you, blind guides! You say, 'If anyone swears by the temple, it means nothing; but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath.' You blind fools! Which is greater: the gold, or the temple that makes the gold sacred? You also say, 'If anyone swears by the altar, it means nothing; but if anyone swears by the gift on it, he is bound by his oath.' You blind men! Which is greater: the gift, or the altar that makes the gift sacred? Therefore, he who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it. And he who swears by the temple swears by it and by the one who dwells in it. And he who swears by heaven swears by God's throne and by the one who sits on it. "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices--mint, dill and cummin. But you have neglected the more important matters of the law--justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former. You blind guides! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel. "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence. Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside also will be clean. "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean. In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness. "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous. And you say, 'If we had lived in the days of our forefathers, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.' So you testify against yourselves that you are the descendants of those who murdered the prophets. Fill up, then, the measure of the sin of your forefathers! "You snakes! You brood of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to hell? Therefore I am sending you prophets and wise men and teachers. Some of them you will kill and crucify; others you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town. And so upon you will come all the righteous blood that has been shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar. I tell you the truth, all this will come upon this generation.

"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing. Look, your house is left to you desolate. For I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'"

As Jesus observed the crowd contributing to the temple treasury, he noticed wealthy individuals generously donating large sums. Then, his gaze fell upon a poor widow who quietly placed just two small copper coins – a mere fraction of a penny – into the collection. Calling his disciples aside, Jesus declared, “I tell you the truth, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others. They all gave out of their wealth, while she, out of her poverty, gave everything she had to live on.”

As Jesus departed the Temple, his disciples excitedly pointed out its impressive architecture and the beautiful stones and dedications adorning the building. One disciple exclaimed, “Look, Teacher! What massive stones! What magnificent buildings!” Jesus responded, “Do you see all these great buildings?” and with a solemn prediction, declared, “Not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down.”

As Jesus sat upon the Mount of Olives, facing the Temple, he was approached privately by his disciples – Peter, James, John, and Andrew. They earnestly questioned him, asking, “Teacher, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are all about to be fulfilled?” Their inquiry reflected a deep desire to understand the timing of future events and the indicators of the end of the age.

Jesus repeatedly warned his followers to be vigilant against deception. He cautioned them to “watch out that no one deceives you,” stating that many would arrive claiming to be “the Christ” or “he,” falsely claiming to be himself and intending to mislead others. Furthermore, he specifically warned against those who would falsely proclaim “the time is near,” urging them not to follow such deceptive claims.


“You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, and it is crucial not to be alarmed, for such events must occur as the beginning of birth pains preceding the end. Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, accompanied by earthquakes in various places and widespread famines.  During this time, you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me. Many will turn away from the faith, betraying one another and deceived by false prophets, while the love of most will grow cold. However, he who stands firm to the end will be saved, and the gospel of the kingdom will be preached to all nations as a testament.  You must be on your guard against local councils and imprisonment, potentially facing flogging and trials before governors and kings, serving as witnesses for me.  Brother will betray brother, and a father his child, and all men will hate you because of me.  Despite this, do not worry about how you will defend yourselves, for the Holy Spirit will provide you with the words and wisdom needed to withstand opposition, and not a single hair of your head will perish through this tribulation; by remaining steadfast, you will gain life.”

As a warning, observant readers should recognize the imminent arrival of “the abomination that causes desolation,” likely signaled by Jerusalem being surrounded by armies.  Following this recognition, those in Judea were instructed to immediately flee to the mountains, abandoning possessions – no one was to descend from roofs or return to fields for anything – and praying for deliverance from a period of unprecedented and devastating distress, stretching from the creation of the world to that very moment.  Pregnant women and nursing mothers faced particularly dire circumstances during this time, and it was crucial to avoid such a flight occurring during winter or the Sabbath, as these would exacerbate the suffering.  According to prophecy, if these “days” had not been shortened by God for the sake of the elect, no one would survive, yet the Lord’s intervention ensured a limited period of tribulation before the fulfillment of further prophecy and the ultimate destruction of Jerusalem.

Jesus warned his followers to be exceedingly cautious and not to be deceived by false appearances. He stated that during his departure, numerous false Christs and prophets would emerge, performing impressive signs and miracles designed to mislead even the most devout. He specifically instructed them not to be swayed by claims of his presence, whether in the desert or within secluded rooms, emphasizing that the Son of Man’s arrival would be sudden and unmistakable, like lightning flashing from the east and visible across the west.  He reiterated that he had forewarned them of this deception, urging vigilance and a refusal to be drawn in by false claims.

Wherever there is a carcass, there the vultures will gather.

Following a period of intense distress, a dramatic sequence of events will unfold. Witnesses will observe a terrifying spectacle: the sun and moon will be darkened, the moon will lose its light, the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies themselves will be shaken. At this time, the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, accompanied by a display of immense power and glory as he comes on the clouds. His angels will be dispatched with a loud trumpet call to gather his elect from the four winds, bringing them from every corner of the earth – from one end of the heavens to the other.  Nations will be gripped by anguish and perplexity, witnessing the roaring and tossing of the sea, and men will faint from terror, anticipating the momentous events unfolding as redemption draws near.

Using the fig tree as a powerful illustration, Jesus taught his disciples a crucial lesson about recognizing the nearness of the Kingdom of God. He explained that just as the fig tree’s tender twigs and emerging leaves signal the arrival of summer, so too would observable signs indicate the imminent arrival of God’s kingdom. He emphasized that “even so, when you see these things happening, you know that it is near, right at the door,” and declared with certainty that “this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened.”  Jesus concluded with a profound statement: “Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.”

The Bible teaches a profound and mysterious truth: no one, not even the highest angels in heaven or the Son of God, possesses knowledge of the specific day or hour of the end times. This secret is exclusively known to the Father alone, highlighting a divine mystery and emphasizing the ultimate sovereignty of God.

As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark; and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.

Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left. Two women will be grinding with a hand mill; one will be taken and the other left. "Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come. But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into.


“Be on guard! You do not know when the Son of Man will return, just as a master leaves his house and entrusts his servants with various tasks, instructing one to keep watch at the door.  Always be alert, for the day of His return could come unexpectedly – whether in the evening, at midnight, when the rooster crows, or at dawn.  Like a faithful and wise servant who diligently provides for his master’s household, you should be prepared to serve with diligence and anticipate His needs. However, beware the wicked servant who, assuming his master’s absence, indulges in excess and mistreats others.  Such a servant will face a terrible judgment: the master will return suddenly and inflict a severe punishment, cutting him apart and assigning him a place of torment alongside the hypocrites.  Furthermore, be mindful of the distractions of life – dissipation, drunkenness, and anxiety – for they can weigh down your hearts and trap you unawares when this day closes upon you unexpectedly, demanding that you stand ready before the Son of Man.”

"At that time the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were foolish and five were wise. The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take any oil with them. The wise, however, took oil in jars along with their lamps. The bridegroom was a long time in coming, and they all became drowsy and fell asleep. "At midnight the cry rang out: 'Here's the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!' "Then all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps. The foolish ones said to the wise, 'Give us some of your oil; our lamps are going out.' "'No,' they replied, 'there may not be enough for both us and you. Instead, go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.' "But while they were on their way to buy the oil, the bridegroom arrived. The virgins who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet. And the door was shut. "Later the others also came. 'Sir! Sir!' they said. 'Open the door for us!' "But he replied, 'I tell you the truth, I don't know you.' "Therefore keep watch, because you do not know the day or the hour.

"Again, it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted his property to them. To one he gave five talents of money, to another two talents, and to another one talent, each according to his ability. Then he went on his journey. The man who had received the five talents went at once and put his money to work and gained five more. So also, the one with the two talents gained two more. But the man who had received the one talent went off, dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money. "After a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them. The man who had received the five talents brought the other five. 'Master,' he said, 'you entrusted me with five talents. See, I have gained five more.' "His master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!' "The man with the two talents also came. 'Master,' he said, 'you entrusted me with two talents; see, I have gained two more.' "His master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!' "Then the man who had received the one talent came. 'Master,' he said, 'I knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed. So I was afraid and went out and hid your talent in the ground. See, here is what belongs to you.' "His master replied, 'You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed? Well then, you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers, so that when I returned I would have received it back with interest. "'Take the talent from him and give it to the one who has the ten talents. For everyone who has will be given more, and he will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him. And throw that worthless servant outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'

"When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his throne in heavenly glory. All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left. "Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.' "Then the righteous will answer him, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?' "The King will reply, 'I tell you the truth, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me.' "Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.' "They also will answer, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?' "He will reply, 'I tell you the truth, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.' "Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life."

Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the Feast. They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request. "Sir," they said, "we would like to see Jesus." Philip went to tell Andrew; Andrew and Philip in turn told Jesus. Jesus replied, "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. I tell you the truth, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds. The man who loves his life will lose it, while the man who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. Whoever serves me must follow me; and where I am, my servant also will be. My Father will honor the one who serves me. "Now my heart is troubled, and what shall I say? 'Father, save me from this hour'? No, it was for this very reason I came to this hour. Father, glorify your name!" Then a voice came from heaven, "I have glorified it, and will glorify it again." The crowd that was there and heard it said it had thundered; others said an angel had spoken to him. Jesus said, "This voice was for your benefit, not mine. Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this world will be driven out. But I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself." He said this to show the kind of death he was going to die. The crowd spoke up, "We have heard from the Law that the Christ will remain forever, so how can you say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this 'Son of Man'?" Then Jesus told them, "You are going to have the light just a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, before darkness overtakes you. The man who walks in the dark does not know where he is going. Put your trust in the light while you have it, so that you may become sons of light." When he had finished speaking, Jesus left and hid himself from them.

When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he said to his disciples, "As you know, the Passover is two days away--and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified."

As the Feast of Unleavened Bread, or Passover, rapidly approached – just two days away – the chief priests and elders of the people, including the high priest Caiaphas, convened in his palace to plot Jesus’s demise. Driven by fear of a potential riot amongst the populace, they sought a discreet method to arrest and kill him, explicitly stating they wouldn’t act during the sacred Feast. This desperate maneuver stemmed from their desire to eliminate Jesus altogether, fearing the unrest his presence might incite.

Driven by temptation, Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve disciples, began his betrayal of Jesus. Initially, he approached the chief priests and offered to hand Jesus over in exchange for thirty silver coins, a proposition they eagerly accepted. Subsequently, Satan entered Judas, prompting him to actively seek out the chief priests and temple guards, outlining his plan to betray Jesus.  Delighted with his proposal, they agreed to provide him with money, and Judas, now watching for a discreet opportunity, waited patiently for a moment when no crowd was present to carry out his treacherous scheme.

Even after Jesus had done all these miraculous signs in their presence, they still would not believe in him. This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet: "Lord, who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?" For this reason they could not believe, because, as Isaiah says elsewhere: "He has blinded their eyes and deadened their hearts, so they can neither see with their eyes, nor understand with their hearts, nor turn--and I would heal them." Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus' glory and spoke about him. Yet at the same time many even among the leaders believed in him. But because of the Pharisees they would not confess their faith for fear they would be put out of the synagogue; for they loved praise from men more than praise from God.

Then Jesus cried out, "When a man believes in me, he does not believe in me only, but in the one who sent me. When he looks at me, he sees the one who sent me. I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in me should stay in darkness. "As for the person who hears my words but does not keep them, I do not judge him. For I did not come to judge the world, but to save it. There is a judge for the one who rejects me and does not accept my words; that very word which I spoke will condemn him at the last day. For I did not speak of my own accord, but the Father who sent me commanded me what to say and how to say it. I know that his command leads to eternal life. So whatever I say is just what the Father has told me to say."

On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, when it was customary to sacrifice the Passover lamb, Jesus’ disciples inquired where they should prepare for the Passover meal. He instructed them to send two of his followers into the city to locate a man carrying a jar of water. They were to follow him to a house and, upon entering, ask the owner for the guest room, stating, “The Teacher asks: Where is my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?” The owner would then direct them to a large, furnished upper room, where they were to make all preparations for the celebration. Peter and John, specifically dispatched by Jesus, followed these instructions and found the room exactly as he had described, proceeding to prepare the Passover as directed.

As evening approached, Jesus arrived with the Twelve and proceeded to recline at the table. The hour drew near, and Jesus and his apostles continued to share a meal, solidifying the intimate setting for what was to come.

And he said to them, "I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it finds fulfillment in the kingdom of God."

It was just before the Passover Feast. Jesus knew that the time had come for him to leave this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he now showed them the full extent of his love. The evening meal was being served, and the devil had already prompted Judas Iscariot, son of Simon, to betray Jesus. Jesus knew that the Father had put all things under his power, and that he had come from God and was returning to God; so he got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around his waist. After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples' feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him. He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, "Lord, are you going to wash my feet?" Jesus replied, "You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand." "No," said Peter, "you shall never wash my feet." Jesus answered, "Unless I wash you, you have no part with me." "Then, Lord," Simon Peter replied, "not just my feet but my hands and my head as well!" Jesus answered, "A person who has had a bath needs only to wash his feet; his whole body is clean. And you are clean, though not every one of you." For he knew who was going to betray him, and that was why he said not every one was clean. When he had finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and returned to his place. "Do you understand what I have done for you?" he asked them. "You call me 'Teacher' and 'Lord,' and rightly so, for that is what I am. Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another's feet. I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you. I tell you the truth, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him. Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.

As Jesus and his disciples reclined at the table and were eating, a palpable tension filled the room. He repeatedly declared, “I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me,” emphasizing that this betrayal would occur among those sharing his meal.  Adding to the unsettling atmosphere, Jesus placed his hand on the table, stating that the hand of the betrayer would be right beside his own.  He then referenced scripture, quoting Psalm 20:17, “He who shares my bread has lifted up his heel against me,” explaining that this prophecy was being fulfilled.  Jesus clarified that he wasn’t speaking of the entire group, but specifically those he had chosen, and that this betrayal was predetermined.  Finally, deeply troubled, he reiterated his warning, stating, “I tell you the truth, one of you is going to betray me,” and connected the act of accepting his chosen disciples with accepting himself and the one who sent him.

As Jesus spoke of impending betrayal, his disciples were overcome with sadness and began to vehemently deny any involvement, each proclaiming, “Surely not I, Lord?” Jesus responded with chilling certainty, stating that the one who had dipped his hand into the bowl with him would be the betrayer, and that woe would be upon the man who committed this act. When Judas, the individual destined to betray him, questioned his own innocence, Jesus directly affirmed, “Yes, it is you.” The disciples, utterly bewildered and unable to discern the meaning, stared at one another in confusion, questioning amongst themselves which of them it might be.  Simon Peter, seeking clarification, gestured to the disciple reclining beside Jesus, the beloved disciple, and asked him to inquire directly of the Lord, who then confirmed Judas’s identity, leaving the remaining disciples in stunned disbelief.

Jesus answered, "It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish." Then, dipping the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, son of Simon. As soon as Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him.

"What you are about to do, do quickly," Jesus told him, but no one at the meal understood why Jesus said this to him. Since Judas had charge of the money, some thought Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the Feast, or to give something to the poor. As soon as Judas had taken the bread, he went out. And it was night.

When he was gone, Jesus said, "Now is the Son of Man glorified and God is glorified in him. If God is glorified in him, God will glorify the Son in himself, and will glorify him at once. "My children, I will be with you only a little longer. You will look for me, and just as I told the Jews, so I tell you now: Where I am going, you cannot come. "A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another."

During a meal with his disciples, Jesus took bread, offered thanks, and broke it into pieces. He then distributed the pieces to his followers, instructing them to “take and eat” – or, as in one account, “take it” – explaining that this was his body, given for them, and to be done in remembrance of him.

Following the supper, Jesus took the cup, gave thanks, and offered it to his disciples. He declared, “This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins,” and instructed them to drink from it. All of them did so, solidifying the covenant established through his sacrifice. Later, he reiterated the significance of the cup, stating it represented “the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.”

Following the sharing of the cup, Jesus expressed a profound and resolute commitment to abstain from the fruit of the vine. He declared, “I tell you the truth, I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it anew in the kingdom of God,” echoing a similar sentiment stated earlier, “I tell you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father’s kingdom.” This vow underscored his anticipation and dedication to experiencing this blessing fully within the context of the ultimate, eternal kingdom.

Also a dispute arose among them as to which of them was considered to be greatest. Jesus said to them, "The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those who exercise authority over them call themselves Benefactors. But you are not to be like that. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who rules like the one who serves. For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who is at the table? But I am among you as one who serves. You are those who have stood by me in my trials. And I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred one on me, so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

As Jesus spoke of being sifted like wheat, Simon Peter, initially eager to follow him anywhere, including to prison or death, questioned his immediate ability to accompany him. Jesus responded that his journey was one Peter couldn’t yet understand, promising a future where he would. However, Jesus then delivered a stark and unsettling prophecy: “I tell you the truth, before the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times.”  Peter, deeply troubled by this prediction, vehemently affirmed his willingness to lay down his life for the Lord, a commitment immediately followed by Jesus’s chilling warning about his impending denial.

"Do not let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God; trust also in me. In my Father's house are many rooms; if it were not so, I would have told you. I am going there to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am. You know the way to the place where I am going." Thomas said to him, "Lord, we don't know where you are going, so how can we know the way?" Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. If you really knew me, you would know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him." Philip said, "Lord, show us the Father and that will be enough for us." Jesus answered: "Don't you know me, Philip, even after I have been among you such a long time? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, 'Show us the Father'? Don't you believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words I say to you are not just my own. Rather, it is the Father, living in me, who is doing his work. Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; or at least believe on the evidence of the miracles themselves. I tell you the truth, anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing. He will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father. And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Son may bring glory to the Father. You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.

"If you love me, you will obey what I command. And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Counselor to be with you forever-- the Spirit of truth. The world cannot accept him, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be in you. I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you. Before long, the world will not see me anymore, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live. On that day you will realize that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you. Whoever has my commands and obeys them, he is the one who loves me. He who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I too will love him and show myself to him." Then Judas (not Judas Iscariot) said, "But, Lord, why do you intend to show yourself to us and not to the world?" Jesus replied, "If anyone loves me, he will obey my teaching. My Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him. He who does not love me will not obey my teaching. These words you hear are not my own; they belong to the Father who sent me. "All this I have spoken while still with you. But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you. Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid. "You heard me say, 'I am going away and I am coming back to you.' If you loved me, you would be glad that I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I. I have told you now before it happens, so that when it does happen you will believe. I will not speak with you much longer, for the prince of this world is coming. He has no hold on me, but the world must learn that I love the Father and that I do exactly what my Father has commanded me.

Then Jesus asked them, "When I sent you without purse, bag or sandals, did you lack anything?Nothing," they answered. He said to them, "But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one. It is written: 'And he was numbered with the transgressors'; and I tell you that this must be fulfilled in me. Yes, what is written about me is reaching its fulfillment." The disciples said, "See, Lord, here are two swords.That is enough," he replied.

After they had sung a hymn, Jesus and his disciples went out to the Mount of Olives. As usual, Jesus had journeyed to the mountain, and his followers trailed behind him.  As they arrived, Jesus said, “Come now; let us leave.” This suggests a planned departure, likely to a specific location or event, following their time of worship and reflection on the mount.

As Jesus spoke of impending betrayal, predicting that all the disciples would fall away on account of him – citing scripture about the shepherd being struck and the flock scattered – Peter vehemently denied any possibility of this happening, declaring he would never disown him. Jesus, in turn, issued a stark and specific prophecy: “I tell you the truth, tonight before the rooster crows twice, you yourself will disown me three times.”  Peter emphatically reaffirmed his unwavering loyalty, insisting even if he had to die alongside Jesus, he would never deny him, a sentiment echoed by all the other disciples present.

"I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener. He cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit, while every branch that does bear fruit he prunes so that it will be even more fruitful. You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you. Remain in me, and I will remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me. "I am the vine; you are the branches. If a man remains in me and I in him, he will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing. If anyone does not remain in me, he is like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned. If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be given you. This is to my Father's glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples. "As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Now remain in my love. If you obey my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have obeyed my Father's commands and remain in his love. I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete. My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends. You are my friends if you do what I command. I no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know his master's business. Instead, I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you. You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit--fruit that will last. Then the Father will give you whatever you ask in my name. This is my command: Love each other.

"If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you. Remember the words I spoke to you: 'No servant is greater than his master.' If they persecuted me, they will persecute you also. If they obeyed my teaching, they will obey yours also. They will treat you this way because of my name, for they do not know the One who sent me. If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin. Now, however, they have no excuse for their sin. He who hates me hates my Father as well. If I had not done among them what no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin. But now they have seen these miracles, and yet they have hated both me and my Father. But this is to fulfill what is written in their Law: 'They hated me without reason.' "When the Counselor comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father, he will testify about me. And you also must testify, for you have been with me from the beginning. "All this I have told you so that you will not go astray. They will put you out of the synagogue; in fact, a time is coming when anyone who kills you will think he is offering a service to God. They will do such things because they have not known the Father or me. I have told you this, so that when the time comes you will remember that I warned you. I did not tell you this at first because I was with you.

"Now I am going to him who sent me, yet none of you asks me, 'Where are you going?' Because I have said these things, you are filled with grief. But I tell you the truth: It is for your good that I am going away. Unless I go away, the Counselor will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you. When he comes, he will convict the world of guilt in regard to sin and righteousness and judgment: in regard to sin, because men do not believe in me; in regard to righteousness, because I am going to the Father, where you can see me no longer; and in regard to judgment, because the prince of this world now stands condemned. "I have much more to say to you, more than you can now bear. But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to come. He will bring glory to me by taking from what is mine and making it known to you. All that belongs to the Father is mine. That is why I said the Spirit will take from what is mine and make it known to you.

"In a little while you will see me no more, and then after a little while you will see me." Some of his disciples said to one another, "What does he mean by saying, 'In a little while you will see me no more, and then after a little while you will see me,' and 'Because I am going to the Father'?" They kept asking, "What does he mean by 'a little while'? We don't understand what he is saying." Jesus saw that they wanted to ask him about this, so he said to them, "Are you asking one another what I meant when I said, 'In a little while you will see me no more, and then after a little while you will see me'? I tell you the truth, you will weep and mourn while the world rejoices. You will grieve, but your grief will turn to joy. A woman giving birth to a child has pain because her time has come; but when her baby is born she forgets the anguish because of her joy that a child is born into the world. So with you: Now is your time of grief, but I will see you again and you will rejoice, and no one will take away your joy. In that day you will no longer ask me anything. I tell you the truth, my Father will give you whatever you ask in my name. Until now you have not asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive, and your joy will be complete.

"Though I have been speaking figuratively, a time is coming when I will no longer use this kind of language but will tell you plainly about my Father. In that day you will ask in my name. I am not saying that I will ask the Father on your behalf. No, the Father himself loves you because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God. I came from the Father and entered the world; now I am leaving the world and going back to the Father." Then Jesus' disciples said, "Now you are speaking clearly and without figures of speech. Now we can see that you know all things and that you do not even need to have anyone ask you questions. This makes us believe that you came from God." "You believe at last!" Jesus answered. "But a time is coming, and has come, when you will be scattered, each to his own home. You will leave me all alone. Yet I am not alone, for my Father is with me. "I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world."

After Jesus said this, he looked toward heaven and prayed: "Father, the time has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son may glorify you. For you granted him authority over all people that he might give eternal life to all those you have given him. Now this is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent. I have brought you glory on earth by completing the work you gave me to do. And now, Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began. "I have revealed you to those whom you gave me out of the world. They were yours; you gave them to me and they have obeyed your word. Now they know that everything you have given me comes from you. For I gave them the words you gave me and they accepted them. They knew with certainty that I came from you, and they believed that you sent me. I pray for them. I am not praying for the world, but for those you have given me, for they are yours. All I have is yours, and all you have is mine. And glory has come to me through them. I will remain in the world no longer, but they are still in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, protect them by the power of your name--the name you gave me--so that they may be one as we are one. While I was with them, I protected them and kept them safe by that name you gave me. None has been lost except the one doomed to destruction so that Scripture would be fulfilled. "I am coming to you now, but I say these things while I am still in the world, so that they may have the full measure of my joy within them. I have given them your word and the world has hated them, for they are not of the world any more than I am of the world. My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one. They are not of the world, even as I am not of it. Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth. As you sent me into the world, I have sent them into the world. For them I sanctify myself, that they too may be truly sanctified. "My prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message, that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me. I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one: I in them and you in me. May they be brought to complete unity to let the world know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me. "Father, I want those you have given me to be with me where I am, and to see my glory, the glory you have given me because you loved me before the creation of the world. "Righteous Father, though the world does not know you, I know you, and they know that you have sent me. I have made you known to them, and will continue to make you known in order that the love you have for me may be in them and that I myself may be in them."

After instructing his disciples to wait while he went to pray, Jesus, accompanied by Peter, James, and John, journeyed to a place called Gethsemane. As he arrived, he expressed a profound sorrow and distress, stating, “My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death.” He then earnestly requested they pray for strength against temptation and, after finishing his private prayer, led his disciples across the Kidron Valley to an olive grove, where they settled in for the night.

As Jesus continued his journey, he deliberately moved a short distance ahead and knelt down, falling to the ground in earnest prayer. Addressing God as “Father,” he pleaded, “If it is possible, may this cup be taken from me,” repeating his desire for God’s will to be done, not his own.  Overcome with anguish, he prayed even more fervently, his sweat becoming like drops of blood. An angel appeared to strengthen him during this intense moment.  Upon rising, he returned to find his disciples asleep and exhausted from sorrow, a testament to the weight of his burden and the depth of his devotion to God’s plan.

Exhausted after his first prayer, Jesus returned to his disciples, who were sleeping, and rebuked them with concern, asking Peter, “Simon, are you asleep?” He urged them to keep watch and pray, reminding them that “the spirit is willing, but the body is weak.” Once again, he withdrew to pray, repeating his plea to his Father, “My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it, may your will be done.”

Jesus returned to find the disciples once again sleeping, their eyes heavy with weariness. He departed and prayed a third time, repeating his urgent plea, before returning to the disciples. This time, he confronted them with a sharper tone, declaring, “Are you still sleeping and resting? Enough!” He emphasized the critical moment, stating, “The hour has come. Look, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!”

As Jesus continued to speak, a crowd armed with swords and clubs, dispatched by the chief priests, teachers of the law, and elders, suddenly appeared. Leading them was Judas, one of the Twelve, who had secretly arranged a signal with the group: “The one I kiss is the man; arrest him.” Approaching Jesus, Judas greeted him as “Rabbi!” and offered a kiss, a pre-arranged betrayal. Jesus, recognizing the deception, inquired, “Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?”  Meanwhile, Judas, aware of Jesus’s frequent meetings with his disciples in a nearby grove, had already gathered a detachment of soldiers and officials from the chief priests and Pharisees, who arrived with torches, lanterns, and weapons, ready to carry out the arrest.

Jesus, knowing all that was going to happen to him, went out and asked them, "Who is it you want?" "Jesus of Nazareth," they replied. "I am he," Jesus said. (And Judas the traitor was standing there with them.) When Jesus said, "I am he," they drew back and fell to the ground. Again he asked them, "Who is it you want?" And they said, "Jesus of Nazareth." "I told you that I am he," Jesus answered. "If you are looking for me, then let these men go." This happened so that the words he had spoken would be fulfilled: "I have not lost one of those you gave me."

As the men seized Jesus and began his arrest, a chaotic scene unfolded. One of Jesus’ companions, witnessing the escalating violence, drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, severing his right ear.  Initially, Jesus’ followers, including Simon Peter, questioned whether they should intervene with force, prompting Peter to draw his own sword and strike the servant, Malchus. However, Jesus swiftly intervened, commanding Peter to “Put your sword away!” and miraculously healed the servant’s ear, stating, “No more of this!”  He then quoted scripture, asserting that his divine Father could provide far more powerful assistance than any earthly weapon, emphasizing that events were unfolding according to a predetermined plan.

As Jesus stood before the assembled crowd, he questioned their intent, stating, “Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me?” He reminded them that he had been teaching daily in the temple courts, yet they had never attempted to arrest him.  He then declared, “But this has all taken place that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled,” a statement that prompted the entire group of disciples to flee.  Later, confronting the chief priests, the temple guard, and the elders who had come to apprehend him, Jesus repeated his incredulity, asking, “Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come with swords and clubs?”  He reiterated his consistent presence in the temple, emphasizing that “the Scriptures must be fulfilled,” and ominously concluded, “But this is your hour—when darkness reigns.”


As Jesus continued his work, everyone deserted him and fled. Then, a detachment of soldiers, accompanied by their commander and Jewish officials, arrived and arrested Jesus. They bound him, effectively taking him into custody. 

---

Would you like me to adjust the paragraph in any way, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or tone?

A young man, wearing nothing but a linen garment, was following Jesus. When they seized him, he fled naked, leaving his garment behind.

Following his arrest, Jesus was taken to Caiaphas, the high priest, where a gathering of key religious figures had assembled. The process involved a group of individuals seizing him and leading him away, ultimately transporting him into the house of the high priest.  There, all the chief priests, elders, and teachers of the law were present, indicating a formal and significant meeting convened by the high priest.

and brought him first to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year. Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jews that it would be good if one man died for the people.

Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus when they entered the courtyard of the high priest. While Jesus proceeded inside, Peter was initially kept outside the gate, waiting. However, the other disciple, known to the high priest, went ahead and, after speaking with the girl on duty, brought Peter in. Peter then followed at a distance, eventually entering the courtyard himself and taking a seat with the guards, observing the unfolding events.

As the evening grew cold, Peter found himself in the courtyard of the high priest, seated with other officials and servants around a fire they had built for warmth. A servant girl, observing him closely in the firelight, approached and questioned him, stating, “You were with that Nazarene, Jesus.” Peter vehemently denied knowing him, repeating his denial to her. Later, another servant girl, while Peter was warming himself, independently approached and similarly questioned him, “You also were with Jesus of Nazareth,” prompting another denial.  A third servant girl, at the entrance to the courtyard, also noticed Peter and inquired if he was one of Jesus’ disciples, further reinforcing his steadfast denial of any association with the Nazarene.

"I don't know or understand what you're talking about," he said, and went out into the entryway.

Meanwhile, the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching. "I have spoken openly to the world," Jesus replied. "I always taught in synagogues or at the temple, where all the Jews come together. I said nothing in secret. Why question me? Ask those who heard me. Surely they know what I said." When Jesus said this, one of the officials nearby struck him in the face. "Is this the way you answer the high priest?" he demanded. "If I said something wrong," Jesus replied, "testify as to what is wrong. But if I spoke the truth, why did you strike me?" Then Annas sent him, still bound, to Caiaphas the high priest.

Driven by a desire to find false evidence and condemn Jesus, the chief priests and the entire Sanhedrin relentlessly questioned him, despite finding no genuine accusations. Numerous false witnesses emerged, claiming Jesus had declared his intention to destroy the Temple and rebuild it in three days, though their testimonies were inconsistent and ultimately contradictory.  When two witnesses finally presented this fabricated claim, the high priest demanded an answer from Jesus, repeatedly charging him under oath to confirm whether he was the Christ, the Son of God. Jesus steadfastly remained silent, only responding with a prophecy of his future return – “You will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.”  Enraged by Jesus’s refusal to answer, the high priest tore his clothes, declaring, “You have heard the blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses?”

As Jesus was brought before the crowd, the hostility quickly escalated. Initially, the men guarding him began mocking and beating him, blindfolding him and demanding he prophesy, repeatedly asking “Who hit you?” Soon, the crowd joined in the assault, spitting in his face and striking him with their fists while others slapped him and urged him to prophesy as well. Ultimately, they all condemned him as worthy of death, confirming his suffering through a brutal combination of physical violence and relentless, insulting demands.

As Simon Peter sought warmth, he was repeatedly questioned about his association with a mysterious man. Initially, when a servant girl observed him present, she declared he was “one of them,” and Peter vehemently denied it. Shortly after, another individual spotted him and accused him of belonging to the same group, prompting Peter’s repeated denials of “I am not!”  Despite these consistent assertions of innocence, the suspicion persisted, culminating in a final, definitive denial when someone directly asked him, “You are not one of his disciples, are you?”

Following a brief period of questioning, a group of onlookers, initially stating Peter was a Galilean – referencing his accent (Source 1 & 2) – then later asserting he had been seen with the man in question in the olive grove (Source 3). Each time Peter vehemently denied any knowledge of the individual, swearing he didn’t know him (“I don’t know the man!” or “I don’t know what you’re talking about!” – Sources 1 & 2 & 3).  The tension escalated when a servant of the high priest, a relative of the man Peter had wounded, directly challenged him about his presence in the olive grove.  As Peter continued to deny the accusation, a rooster suddenly crowed, confirming his lie and marking the final moment of his denial (Source 4).

Immediately the rooster crowed the second time.

As the first rooster crowed, Peter was suddenly struck with a terrifying realization. He recalled the precise words Jesus had spoken to him – “Before the rooster crows *today*, you will disown me three times.” The Lord, witnessing Peter’s distress, turned and looked directly at him, reinforcing the chilling prophecy. Overwhelmed by the weight of his impending betrayal, Peter immediately went outside and wept bitterly, his heart shattered by the knowledge of his future failure.

As daybreak approached, a concerted effort was made to bring Jesus to justice. Early in the morning, the chief priests, along with the elders, teachers of the law, and the entire Sanhedrin council, reached a decision to put him to death. They led Jesus before them, initiating a tense interrogation where they demanded he identify himself. “If you are the Christ, tell us,” they challenged. Jesus responded that they wouldn’t believe him, and they wouldn’t answer his questions. However, he declared his future role as the Son of Man seated at the right hand of God. Pressed further with the question, “Are you then the Son of God?” he affirmed their correct assessment. Finally, convinced by his own words, the council declared, “We have heard it from his own lips,” effectively concluding their need for further testimony.

When Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he was seized with remorse and returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and the elders. "I have sinned," he said, "for I have betrayed innocent blood.What is that to us?" they replied. "That's your responsibility." So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself. The chief priests picked up the coins and said, "It is against the law to put this into the treasury, since it is blood money." So they decided to use the money to buy the potter's field as a burial place for foreigners. That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day. Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: "They took the thirty silver coins, the price set on him by the people of Israel, and they used them to buy the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me."

As the day began, the Jewish leaders, having apprehended Jesus from the house of Caiaphas under the authority of Pontius Pilate, bound him and led him away. Accusations flew as they marched him toward the Roman governor’s palace, claiming he was subverting the nation by rejecting taxes to Caesar and proclaiming himself a king. The assembly rose to escort him, and Pilate, emerging to question the charges, was met with a chorus of accusations – that Jesus was a criminal deserving of punishment. Despite the Jews’ objections that they lacked the authority to execute him, Pilate ultimately conceded, allowing them to take Jesus for their own judgment, all the while aware that this sequence of events was orchestrated to fulfill the prophecies of Jesus’ impending death.

As Jesus stood before the Roman governor, Pontius Pilate, he was repeatedly questioned about his kingship. Initially, Pilate directly asked, “Are you the king of the Jews?” to which Jesus affirmed, “Yes, it is as you say.”  The chief priests and elders relentlessly accused him of numerous offenses, prompting Pilate to repeatedly inquire if Jesus would offer any defense, expressing his astonishment at the man’s silence.  Despite the overwhelming accusations, Jesus remained steadfastly silent, refusing to answer even a single charge.  Pilate, attempting to find grounds for condemnation, ultimately declared he found no basis for a charge, yet Jesus skillfully deflected the accusations, arguing his kingdom was not of this world and responding to Pilate’s assertion that he was a king with the statement, “You are right in saying I am a king. In fact, for this reason I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth.”  Finally, Pilate, confused by Jesus’s words and seeking a justification for his actions, questioned Jesus about the nature of truth itself, before returning to the Jewish leaders and reiterating his lack of evidence against him.

But they insisted, "He stirs up the people all over Judea by his teaching. He started in Galilee and has come all the way here." On hearing this, Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean. When he learned that Jesus was under Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time. When Herod saw Jesus, he was greatly pleased, because for a long time he had been wanting to see him. From what he had heard about him, he hoped to see him perform some miracle. He plied him with many questions, but Jesus gave him no answer. The chief priests and the teachers of the law were standing there, vehemently accusing him. Then Herod and his soldiers ridiculed and mocked him. Dressing him in an elegant robe, they sent him back to Pilate. That day Herod and Pilate became friends--before this they had been enemies.

While Pilate was sitting on the judge's seat, his wife sent him this message: "Don't have anything to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him."

Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers and the people, and said to them, "You brought me this man as one who was inciting the people to rebellion. I have examined him in your presence and have found no basis for your charges against him. Neither has Herod, for he sent him back to us; as you can see, he has done nothing to deserve death. Therefore, I will punish him and then release him."

As the Passover Feast approached, it was a long-standing custom for the governor to release a prisoner chosen by the crowd. A particularly notorious prisoner, named Barabbas, was held in custody – he was imprisoned alongside insurrectionists who had committed murder during the recent uprising. When the crowd gathered, Pilate was presented with the familiar dilemma: he could release either Barabbas or Jesus, who was known as Christ. Aware that the chief priests were motivated by envy in their plot to have Jesus handed over, Pilate inquired, “Do you want me to release to you Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?” He was fulfilling the established tradition of granting the people’s request for a prisoner’s release, echoing the phrase “Do you want me to release ‘the king of the Jews’?” as he did every year.

As Jesus stood before Pontius Pilate, the chief priests and elders, fueled by a calculated effort to incite the crowd, relentlessly pressured the Roman governor to release Barabbas. They repeatedly urged the people to demand Jesus’ execution, claiming, “Which of the two do you want me to release to you?”  The crowd, swayed by this manipulation, responded with a unified cry, “Away with this man! Release Barabbas to us!”  Barabbas, a known agitator who had been imprisoned for an insurrection and murder, was the desired alternative to Jesus.  The desperate plea echoed through the square: “No, not him! Give us Barabbas!”

As Jesus, known as the king of the Jews, was brought before Pontius Pilate, the governor repeatedly questioned the crowd about his fate. “What shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called Christ?” or “What shall I do, then, with the one you call the king of the Jews?” Pilate inquired, each time asking why he should execute a man he found no grounds to punish. Yet, with each plea, the crowd responded with increasingly fervent demands: “Crucify him!” Despite Pilate’s repeated attempts to understand and release Jesus, their insistent shouts – “Crucify him!” – overwhelmed his judgment, ultimately leading to the man’s crucifixion.

Following his arrest, Jesus was taken by the governor’s soldiers into the Praetorium, where a large contingent of soldiers gathered around him. Initially, they stripped him and clothed him in a scarlet robe, then twisted together a crown of thorns and placed it upon his head, accompanied by the mocking proclamation of “Hail, king of the Jews!” They knelt before him, striking him repeatedly with a staff and spitting upon him. Later, the soldiers, under Pilate’s direction, subjected him to flogging before once again donning him in a purple robe, placing the thorny crown upon his head, and continuing their derisive salutations and violent assaults, shouting “Hail, king of the Jews!” and striking him in the face.

Once more Pilate came out and said to the Jews, "Look, I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against him." When Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate said to them, "Here is the man!" As soon as the chief priests and their officials saw him, they shouted, "Crucify! Crucify!" But Pilate answered, "You take him and crucify him. As for me, I find no basis for a charge against him." The Jews insisted, "We have a law, and according to that law he must die, because he claimed to be the Son of God." When Pilate heard this, he was even more afraid, and he went back inside the palace. "Where do you come from?" he asked Jesus, but Jesus gave him no answer. "Do you refuse to speak to me?" Pilate said. "Don't you realize I have power either to free you or to crucify you?" Jesus answered, "You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin." From then on, Pilate tried to set Jesus free, but the Jews kept shouting, "If you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar." When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge's seat at a place known as the Stone Pavement (which in Aramaic is Gabbatha). It was the day of Preparation of Passover Week, about the sixth hour. "Here is your king," Pilate said to the Jews. But they shouted, "Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him!Shall I crucify your king?" Pilate asked. "We have no king but Caesar," the chief priests answered.

When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. "I am innocent of this man's blood," he said. "It is your responsibility!" All the people answered, "Let his blood be on us and on our children!"


As a crowd demanded it, Pontius Pilate, wanting to appease them, released Barabbas, a prisoner previously condemned for insurrection and murder. Simultaneously, he ordered Jesus to be flogged and then, ultimately, surrendered him to their will, deciding to grant their demand and handing him over to be crucified.

Following a period of mockery, the soldiers stripped Jesus of his royal purple robe and replaced it with his own simple garments. Then, under their command, Jesus was led out to Golgotha, the place of the Skull, and forced to carry his own cross as he was taken to be crucified.

As Jesus and his followers were departing, they encountered Simon, a man from Cyrene, who was traveling into the city.  Seizing him unexpectedly, they forced Simon to carry the cross, taking him from his journey and placing it upon his shoulders as they led him away.  Simon, identified as the father of Alexander and Rufus, was clearly on his way in from the country when this occurred.

A large number of people followed him, including women who mourned and wailed for him. Jesus turned and said to them, "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; weep for yourselves and for your children. For the time will come when you will say, 'Blessed are the barren women, the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!' Then "'they will say to the mountains, "Fall on us!" and to the hills, "Cover us!"' For if men do these things when the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?"

As Jesus was led to the place known as Golgotha, meaning “The Place of the Skull,” he was offered wine mixed with gall or myrrh – depending on the account – but he refused to drink it. Following this, he was crucified, alongside two other criminals, one positioned on his right and the other on his left, with Jesus placed in the center of the cross. After his death, his garments were divided among the soldiers by casting lots.

Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing." And they divided up his clothes by casting lots.

After Jesus was condemned and sat awaiting his fate, the Roman soldiers began to prepare for his crucifixion. They first divided up his clothing, casting lots to determine who would receive each piece. When the crucifixion finally took place, they meticulously took his clothes, dividing them into four equal shares. Notably, they preserved a seamless, single-piece undergarment, recognizing its significance.  Discussing its value, they agreed not to tear it and instead decided to award it by lot, ensuring that a prophecy – “They divided my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing” – would be fulfilled.

It was the third hour when they crucified him.

As Jesus was crucified, a written charge was affixed above his head, initially stating “THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.” Later, a more detailed notice was prepared by Pilate and fastened to the cross, reading “JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.” This sign was written in Aramaic, Latin, and Greek, and placed in a location near the city where many Jews could read it. However, the chief priests vehemently objected, arguing that the sign should not claim Jesus *claimed* to be king, but rather asserted his actual kingship. Despite their protests, Pilate firmly declared, “What I have written, I have written.”

Here’s a coherent narrative paragraph consolidating the information from the three sources:

As he was led to his execution, two other men, both criminals, were also brought out to be executed alongside him. They were crucified on either side of him – one on his right and one on his left, a grim testament to their crimes.

As Jesus hung on the cross, a chorus of derision rose from those gathered below. The passersby hurled insults, shaking their heads and demanding he “save himself” by descending from the cross, proclaiming him a false claimant who would “destroy the temple and build it in three days.”  The chief priests, teachers of the law, and elders joined in the mockery, questioning why he could save others but not himself, and citing his claim as “King of Israel,” urging him to “come down now” if he truly believed in God’s power to rescue him. Even the two other men crucified alongside him added to the jeers, relentlessly taunting him with accusations and doubts.  The rulers, observing from a distance, also sneered, repeating the same challenge: “He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Christ of God, the Chosen One.”

The soldiers also came up and mocked him. They offered him wine vinegar and said, "If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself."

One of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him: "Aren't you the Christ? Save yourself and us!" But the other criminal rebuked him. "Don't you fear God," he said, "since you are under the same sentence? We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong." Then he said, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom. " Jesus answered him, "I tell you the truth, today you will be with me in paradise."

Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus saw his mother there, and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, "Dear woman, here is your son," and to the disciple, "Here is your mother." From that time on, this disciple took her into his home.

Around the sixth hour, a profound darkness descended upon the entire land, lasting until the ninth. Witnesses reported that the sun simply ceased to shine, plunging the world into an unsettling gloom. This period of darkness stretched for exactly three hours, effectively encompassing the sixth, seventh, and eighth hours of the day.

As the ninth hour approached, Jesus cried out in a desperate plea, “Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?” – a phrase that translated to “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” Witnesses present at the scene, some standing nearby and others further away, heard his anguished cry.  Upon hearing it, several individuals remarked that he was calling out for Elijah, suggesting a connection to the prophet’s return.

As the events unfolded, one man quickly ran to obtain a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar, secured it to a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink. Recognizing that all was now complete and desiring to fulfill a prophecy, Jesus expressed his thirst and requested the offering.  A jar of wine vinegar was brought forth, and they carefully soaked a sponge in it, attaching it to a stalk of hyssop before gently lifting it to his lips.

As the situation escalated, a group of onlookers urged everyone to step back. One person shouted, “Now leave him alone,” while another, with a more ominous tone, declared, “Now leave him alone. Let’s see if Elijah comes to *take him down*,” suggesting a deliberate and potentially dangerous confrontation was expected, waiting for Elijah to intervene.

When he had received the drink, Jesus said, "It is finished." With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.

Jesus called out with a loud voice, "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit." When he had said this, he breathed his last.

As Jesus continued to cry out in a loud voice, a final, piercing breath escaped him, marking the end of his earthly life. With that last, resounding breath, he gave up his spirit, signaling the completion of his mission and the fulfillment of prophecy.

As Jesus’ resurrection drew near, a dramatic event unfolded within the Temple. The curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom – a singular, powerful occurrence described repeatedly. Simultaneously, the earth trembled and rocks split, and the tombs of countless holy people who had passed away were violently opened, releasing their resurrected bodies. These figures, reminiscent of those who had appeared after Jesus’ own resurrection, then journeyed into the holy city, startling and confirming the faith of many who witnessed their miraculous return.

As the earthquake shook the ground and the events surrounding Jesus’ death unfolded, a Roman centurion stationed nearby, who had been guarding him, was profoundly moved. Hearing Jesus’ final cry and witnessing his demise, the centurion was overcome with terror and exclaimed, “Surely he was the Son of God!”  Following this initial reaction, he continued to reflect on the magnitude of what he had seen, praising God and declaring, “Surely this was a righteous man.”

When all the people who had gathered to witness this sight saw what took place, they beat their breasts and went away.

As Jesus approached Jerusalem, a significant group of women stood at a distance, observing the events unfolding. These included women who had faithfully followed him from Galilee, providing care and support on his journey – specifically Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee’s sons.  Furthermore, many other women who had traveled with him to Jerusalem were also present, alongside figures like Salome.  Those who knew Jesus personally, all of them, watched from afar, witnessing the unfolding drama.

Now it was the day of Preparation, and the next day was to be a special Sabbath. Because the Jews did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the Sabbath, they asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down. The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus, and then those of the other. But when they came to Jesus and found that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. Instead, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus' side with a spear, bringing a sudden flow of blood and water. The man who saw it has given testimony, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, and he testifies so that you also may believe. These things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled: "Not one of his bones will be broken," and, as another scripture says, "They will look on the one they have pierced."

As Preparation Day drew to a close, Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the Council and a man waiting for the kingdom of God from the Judean town of Arimathea, boldly approached Pilate and requested Jesus’ body. Initially surprised to learn that Jesus had already died, Pilate summoned a centurion to confirm the news, whereupon he granted Joseph’s request.  Interestingly, Joseph was also a secret disciple of Jesus, motivated by fear of the Jewish authorities.  Later, as evening approached, Joseph returned to Pilate, receiving permission to take the body away, ensuring its respectful burial.

As Preparation Day approached and the Sabbath was imminent, Joseph, accompanied by Nicodemus who had previously visited Jesus at night and brought seventy-five pounds of myrrh and aloes, carefully took down the body of Jesus. Following Jewish burial customs, they wrapped the body in strips of linen, mixed with the spices, and transported it to a new tomb recently cut out of rock – a tomb in which no one had ever been laid. Joseph then rolled a large stone in front of the entrance to secure the body, ensuring its respectful and undisturbed rest.


Following Jesus’ crucifixion, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary – likely Mary the mother of Joses – sat in stunned disbelief opposite the empty tomb.  They had traveled from Galilee with numerous other women, and after locating Joseph of Arimathea, they followed him to the tomb itself, witnessing firsthand how his body was carefully laid within.  Finally, both Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses observed the scene, confirming the location where Jesus had been placed.

Then they went home and prepared spices and perfumes. But they rested on the Sabbath in obedience to the commandment.

The next day, the one after Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate. "Sir," they said, "we remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said, 'After three days I will rise again.' So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day. Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead. This last deception will be worse than the first." "Take a guard," Pilate answered. "Go, make the tomb as secure as you know how." So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard.

When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices so that they might go to anoint Jesus' body.

Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and discovered that the stone had been rolled away from the entrance. Shortly after, around sunrise, she joined with the other Mary, and together they went to inform the disciples. As they approached, they began to question each other, wondering who would roll the stone away. Having prepared spices, the women had already set out to the tomb, and upon arriving, they found it empty, confirming their initial concern and prompting them to begin their journey back to the disciples with the news.

There was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and, going to the tomb, rolled back the stone and sat on it. His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow. The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men.


As the women approached the tomb, they looked up and discovered that the massive stone which had sealed the entrance had been rolled away, revealing the space within. They found the stone rolled away from the tomb, confirming their worst fears and initiating the astonishing events that would follow.

but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.

As the group cautiously entered the tomb, they were immediately startled by a young man seated on the right side, clad in a pristine white robe. Just as they began to ponder this unexpected sight, a sudden and dramatic shift occurred – two men, appearing as if they were shimmering with an electric glow, materialized beside them, further adding to the unsettling atmosphere of the ancient chamber.

The women, gripped by fear, were desperately searching for Jesus, having heard he had been crucified. An angel appeared and reassured them, stating, “Don’t be alarmed,” and confirming that Jesus, the Nazarene, was not to be found in death. He had risen, just as he had foretold, and instructed them to go to the place where his body had been laid – the empty tomb. As they began to approach, the men present cautioned them, “Why do you look for the living among the dead?” demonstrating their disbelief and urging them to reconsider their search.

he has risen! Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee: 'The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.'" Then they remembered his words.

Following the crucifixion, the Apostle instructed the disciples to quickly deliver a vital message: “He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.” He then specifically directed them to inform both the disciples and Peter of this news, reiterating that “I have told you” – emphasizing the urgency and importance of spreading the astonishing truth of Jesus’ resurrection.

Trembling and bewildered, the women went out and fled from the tomb. They said nothing to anyone, because they were afraid.

So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples.

So she came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved, and said, "They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know where they have put him!"

Following the crucifixion, Peter and the other disciple immediately set out to the tomb. The other disciple, faster than Peter, arrived first and, bending over, observed the strips of linen lying alone within. He didn’t enter, but Peter, arriving shortly after, went inside and discovered not only the linen but also the burial cloth that had been wrapped around Jesus’ head, which was neatly folded aside from the linen.  Finally, the first disciple entered as well, confirming what he had seen and, despite their lack of understanding from Scripture, believing in the resurrection.  After this, the disciples returned to their homes.

On the first day of the week, early in the morning, Jesus rose from the tomb. He first appeared to Mary Magdalene, whom he had previously delivered from seven demons. Meanwhile, Mary Magdalene was weeping outside the tomb, distraught over Jesus’s disappearance. She discovered two angels seated before the empty space where his body had been, and they inquired about her sorrow. Confused and believing Jesus was gone, she recounted her distress to the angels. Suddenly, Jesus appeared before her, but she didn’t recognize him, mistaking him for the gardener. He gently questioned her about her tears, and when she inquired about his whereabouts, he identified himself as “Mary.” Overwhelmed with joy and recognizing his voice, she cried out, “Rabboni!” – “Teacher!” – before Jesus instructed her to share the news with his brothers, assuring her that he was returning to the Father and their Father, to their God and their God.

Suddenly Jesus met them. "Greetings," he said. They came to him, clasped his feet and worshiped him. Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me."

While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened. When the chief priests had met with the elders and devised a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money, telling them, "You are to say, 'His disciples came during the night and stole him away while we were asleep.' If this report gets to the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble." So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. And this story has been widely circulated among the Jews to this very day.

Following the resurrection, Mary Magdalene rushed to the disciples, proclaiming with fervent conviction, “I have seen the Lord!” She then relayed his words to them, alongside Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women who had been present at the tomb. When the returning group from the tomb shared their own accounts of witnessing Jesus’s resurrection, the disciples, along with the other gathered men, dismissed their testimonies as unbelievable and nonsensical. Despite the women’s repeated insistence that they had indeed seen the risen Christ, those present remained unconvinced, clinging to their skepticism.

and saying, "It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon."

Following Jesus’s death and resurrection, two disciples, Cleopas and another unnamed companion, were traveling to a village called Emmaus approximately seven miles from Jerusalem. As they walked and discussed the recent events – particularly Jesus’s ministry, his arrest, and crucifixion – Jesus unexpectedly joined them, taking on a different form that they failed to recognize. He inquired about their conversation, and upon learning they were lamenting the failure of Jesus to be Israel’s promised redeemer, he began to explain the Scriptures, starting with Moses and all the Prophets, illuminating how the events surrounding Jesus fulfilled ancient prophecies. They recounted the women’s visit to the empty tomb and their report of seeing angels, alongside the men’s own unsuccessful search for Jesus’s body, demonstrating their continued disbelief.  Jesus then pointed out the significance of his suffering and eventual glory, patiently guiding them toward understanding the truth of his resurrection.

As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus acted as if he were going farther. But they urged him strongly, "Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is almost over." So he went in to stay with them. When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them. Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight. They asked each other, "Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?"

Following the initial reports of the resurrected Jesus, two disciples immediately returned to Jerusalem and found the Eleven and the other disciples gathered together.  They excitedly shared their encounter with the risen Christ, describing the journey and how Jesus had been recognized when he broke bread. However, their accounts were met with disbelief by the assembled group, who ultimately did not accept their testimony.

On the evening of the first day of the week, as the disciples were gathered together with the doors locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus unexpectedly appeared among them and greeted them with “Peace be with you!” They were startled and frightened, initially believing they were seeing a ghost, and questioned his presence, citing their lack of faith and their resistance to believing reports of his resurrection. Jesus, however, immediately reassured them, stating, “It is I myself!” He then demonstrated his identity by showing them his hands and feet, urging them to touch him and dispel their doubts. Despite their initial shock and joy, they still struggled to fully accept the reality of his resurrection.  Later, as they continued to discuss the events, Jesus reappeared to the Eleven as they were eating, rebuking them for their continued stubborn disbelief in those who had witnessed his rising.  Finally, he showed them a piece of broiled fish and ate it before their eyes, solidifying his presence and offering tangible proof of his resurrected state.

Again Jesus said, "Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I am sending you." And with that he breathed on them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive anyone his sins, they are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven."

He said to them, "This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms." Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures. He told them, "This is what is written: The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day, and repentance and forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things.
