Six days before the Passover, Jesus arrived at Bethany, where Lazarus lived, and a dinner was given in his honor. While reclining at the table with Lazarus, Martha served, and a woman named Mary brought a pint of pure nard, an expensive perfume, and poured it on Jesus’ feet, wiping them with her hair. Some of the disciples, including Judas Iscariot, who later betrayed him, protested, arguing that the perfume’s value – worth a year’s wages – should have been given to the poor. Jesus rebuked them, stating that they were troubling Mary and that she had done a beautiful thing, preparing him for burial. He affirmed that the poor would always be with them, but he would not, and declared that her act of devotion would be remembered throughout the world as the gospel was preached.

Meanwhile a large crowd of Jews found out that Jesus was there and came, not only because of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus as well, for on account of him many of the Jews were going over to Jesus and putting their faith in him.

The next day the great crowd that had come for the Feast heard that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. They took palm branches and went out to meet him, shouting, "Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!Blessed is the King of Israel!"

As Jesus approached Jerusalem and arrived at Bethphage and Bethany on the Mount of Olives, he dispatched two disciples to secure a donkey and a colt. The disciples were instructed to find a colt tied near the village entrance, and upon locating it, to bring it to him, informing anyone who questioned their actions that the Lord required it.  Initially, some witnesses questioned the disciples’ actions, but they responded with the phrase “The Lord needs it,” allowing them to proceed.  Upon arrival, the disciples placed cloaks over the animal and Jesus sat upon the colt, fulfilling a prophecy foretold by the prophet: “See, your king comes to you, gentle and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.”  The disciples did not fully comprehend the significance of this event until after Jesus’s glorification, when they recognized the fulfillment of the prophecy in their actions.

As Jesus journeyed along, a vast crowd spread cloaks and branches—cut from trees and fields—on the road ahead of him and behind, shouting “Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!” and proclaiming “Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David! Hosanna in the highest!” As he approached the Mount of Olives, the disciples joyfully praised God in loud voices, recounting the miracles they had witnessed, declaring “Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!” Some Pharisees within the crowd urged Jesus to rebuke his disciples, to which he responded with a warning that the stones themselves would cry out if they remained silent.

As he approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it and said, "If you, even you, had only known on this day what would bring you peace--but now it is hidden from your eyes. The days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you and encircle you and hem you in on every side. They will dash you to the ground, you and the children within your walls. They will not leave one stone on another, because you did not recognize the time of God's coming to you."

When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the city was stirred with questions about his identity, with the crowds proclaiming him “this is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee.” Following this, the followers of Jesus, those who had witnessed his miraculous raising of Lazarus from the dead, continued to spread the word of his deeds.  As a result of this news and the reported miracle, many people traveled to meet him, prompting the Pharisees to express their concern, stating, “See, this is getting us nowhere. Look how the whole world has gone after him!”

Jesus entered Jerusalem and went to the temple, looking around at everything but, due to the late hour, he proceeded to Bethany with the Twelve. After spending the night in Bethany, he then departed from there and continued on to the city.

The following day, as Jesus and his disciples were leaving Bethany, Jesus felt hungry and noticed a fig tree in the distance with leaves. He went to investigate, hoping for fruit, but found only leaves, as it was not the season for figs. Disappointed, he then spoke to the tree, declaring, “May no one ever eat fruit from you again,” and his disciples heard his words. Earlier that morning, while returning to the city, he had also been hungry and encountered a fig tree by the roadside, discovering it bare of fruit save for its leaves.

Upon reaching Jerusalem, Jesus entered the temple area and began driving out those who were buying and selling, overturning the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves. He would not allow anyone to carry merchandise through the temple courts, declaring, “It is written: ‘My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations,’ but you have made it ‘a den of robbers.’”

As Jesus continued to teach daily at the temple, drawing a crowd of amazed listeners, the chief priests and teachers of the law, fearing his growing influence and the public’s fascination with his words, began searching for a means to eliminate him. Despite their efforts to find a way to kill him, they were consistently unsuccessful, unable to disrupt his teachings due to the unwavering attention of the people.

The blind and the lame came to him at the temple, and he healed them. But when the chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did and the children shouting in the temple area, "Hosanna to the Son of David," they were indignant. "Do you hear what these children are saying?" they asked him. "Yes," replied Jesus, "have you never read, "'From the lips of children and infants you have ordained praise'?"

When evening came, they went out of the city.

Each day Jesus was teaching at the temple, and each evening he went out to spend the night on the hill called the Mount of Olives, and all the people came early in the morning to hear him at the temple.

As they traveled along, the disciples observed the withered fig tree, discovered in the morning with its roots decayed. Peter, remembering Jesus’s earlier command, exclaimed, “Rabbi, look! The fig tree you cursed has withered!” Jesus responded, “Have faith in God,” and then explained his power, stating, “I tell you the truth, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and it will be done. If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer.’ He further emphasized the importance of unwavering belief, stating, “Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.”

As Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, the chief priests, elders, and teachers of the law approached him, demanding to know by what authority he was performing his miracles and questioning who granted him that authority. Jesus responded with a question of his own: “John’s baptism—was it from heaven, or from men?” The religious leaders deliberated, recognizing that claiming it came from heaven would prompt Jesus to question their lack of belief in John, while admitting it originated from men risked public condemnation due to the widespread belief that John was a prophet. Unable to provide a definitive answer, they responded, “We don’t know,” to which Jesus affirmed, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.”

"What do you think? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first and said, 'Son, go and work today in the vineyard.' "'I will not,' he answered, but later he changed his mind and went. "Then the father went to the other son and said the same thing. He answered, 'I will, sir,' but he did not go. "Which of the two did what his father wanted?The first," they answered. Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you. For John came to you to show you the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did. And even after you saw this, you did not repent and believe him.

A landowner planted a vineyard, surrounding it with a wall, constructing a winepress and watchtower, and then rented it to some farmers before departing on a journey. Upon approaching harvest time, he dispatched servants repeatedly to collect the fruit, but each time the tenants violently resisted, beating, killing, and ultimately murdering the servants.  He then sent his son, whom he loved, hoping for respect, but the tenants, recognizing him as the heir, conspired to kill him and seize the vineyard’s inheritance.  They succeeded in murdering the son and casting him out, and upon hearing this, the listeners prophesied that the landowner would return to punish the tenants by killing them and leasing the vineyard to new farmers who would yield their share at harvest time.

Jesus, addressing his disciples, quoted scripture – “‘The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes’?” He then explained its significance, stating that the kingdom of God would be transferred to a different people, those who would “produce its fruit.”  He further elaborated, warning that anyone who fell upon this “stone” – referring to the rejected cornerstone – would be “broken to pieces,” while those upon whom it fell would be “crushed.”  He repeated the quoted scripture, looking directly at his disciples, emphasizing the prophecy’s implications.

When Jesus spoke his parables, the chief priests and Pharisees immediately recognized their intended meaning and sought a way to arrest him. However, aware of the people’s belief that he was a prophet and fearing a public reaction, they abandoned their plan and departed, while the teachers of the law and chief priests continued to search for an opportunity to seize him immediately, also motivated by his words spoken against them and their subsequent fear of the crowd.

Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying: "The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son. He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the banquet to tell them to come, but they refused to come. "Then he sent some more servants and said, 'Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner: My oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.' "But they paid no attention and went off--one to his field, another to his business. The rest seized his servants, mistreated them and killed them. The king was enraged. He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city. "Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding banquet is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come. Go to the street corners and invite to the banquet anyone you find.' So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad, and the wedding hall was filled with guests. "But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes. 'Friend,' he asked, 'how did you get in here without wedding clothes?' The man was speechless. "Then the king told the attendants, 'Tie him hand and foot, and throw him outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.' "For many are invited, but few are chosen."

The Pharisees, observing Jesus’s integrity and unwillingness to be swayed by social status, dispatched spies disguised as honest men to trap him with a question regarding the payment of taxes to Caesar. They approached Jesus, asserting their knowledge of his truthful teachings and inquiring about the legality of paying taxes, hoping to expose a contradiction in his words. Jesus, recognizing their deceptive intent, challenged them to produce a denarius, questioning the portrait and inscription on the coin. Upon receiving the coin and confirming it bore Caesar’s image, he responded with the dictum “Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s,” leaving the Pharisees astonished and unable to refute his answer, ultimately silencing their attempt to capture him in a verbal trap.

Some Sadducees, who denied the resurrection, approached Jesus with a perplexing question: “Teacher,” they said, “Moses wrote that if a man’s brother dies without children, the man must marry the widow and have children for his brother. Now there were seven brothers; the first married and died childless, passing his wife to the second, who also died without children, followed by the third, and so on, until the seventh. Finally, the woman died, and at the resurrection, whose wife will she be of the seven, since all were married to her?” Jesus responded, correcting their misunderstanding, stating they were in error due to a lack of knowledge regarding Scripture and God’s power, explaining that at the resurrection, neither marriage nor giving in marriage would exist, and people would be like the angels in heaven. He then referenced God’s declaration to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob – “I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob” – emphasizing that God is the God of the living, not the dead, and that they were mistaken to believe in the possibility of this woman having multiple husbands at the resurrection.

Upon hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, a group of Pharisees, including an expert in the law, gathered to question him. The expert posed the question of which commandment was the greatest, to which Jesus responded with the foundational principle: “Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.” He then added, “And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.” A teacher of the law, observing Jesus’s insightful answer, further inquired about the most important commandment, prompting Jesus to elaborate, stating, “The most important one is this: ‘Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind and with all your strength.’ The second is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no commandment greater than these,” adding that loving God with all one’s being and one’s neighbor was more significant than sacrifices. Impressed by his wisdom, Jesus declared, “You are not far from the kingdom of God,” and from that point forward, no one dared to question him further.

While teaching in the temple courts, Jesus questioned the Pharisees about their understanding of the Christ, specifically asking, “How is it that the teachers of the law say that the Christ is the son of David?” He then quoted from Psalm 109: “The Lord said to my Lord: ‘Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet.’” Jesus pressed them further, asking, “If David calls him ‘Lord,’ how can he be his son?” The Pharisees, unable to respond, ceased to question him after that day.

As Jesus taught, he cautioned his followers to obey the teachers of the law and the Pharisees, who occupied a prominent position in Jewish society, yet warned against imitating their superficial displays of piety. These leaders were characterized by their ostentatious attire – flowing robes and long tassels – their desire for social recognition, including prominent seating at banquets and marketplaces, and their penchant for lengthy, performative prayers. Jesus specifically forbade his disciples from calling them “Rabbi,” “father,” or “teacher,” emphasizing that they were all brothers in Christ and that true leadership involved humility, stating that the greatest among them would be their servant. He further warned against their exploitation of the vulnerable, citing their practice of “devouring widows’ houses,” and declared that such individuals would face severe punishment.

"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut the kingdom of heaven in men's faces. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those enter who are trying to. See Footnote "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of hell as you are. "Woe to you, blind guides! You say, 'If anyone swears by the temple, it means nothing; but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath.' You blind fools! Which is greater: the gold, or the temple that makes the gold sacred? You also say, 'If anyone swears by the altar, it means nothing; but if anyone swears by the gift on it, he is bound by his oath.' You blind men! Which is greater: the gift, or the altar that makes the gift sacred? Therefore, he who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it. And he who swears by the temple swears by it and by the one who dwells in it. And he who swears by heaven swears by God's throne and by the one who sits on it. "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices--mint, dill and cummin. But you have neglected the more important matters of the law--justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former. You blind guides! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel. "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence. Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside also will be clean. "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean. In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness. "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous. And you say, 'If we had lived in the days of our forefathers, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.' So you testify against yourselves that you are the descendants of those who murdered the prophets. Fill up, then, the measure of the sin of your forefathers! "You snakes! You brood of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to hell? Therefore I am sending you prophets and wise men and teachers. Some of them you will kill and crucify; others you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town. And so upon you will come all the righteous blood that has been shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar. I tell you the truth, all this will come upon this generation.

"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing. Look, your house is left to you desolate. For I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'"

As Jesus observed the crowd depositing their offerings into the temple treasury, he noticed many wealthy individuals contributing large sums. Simultaneously, he saw a poor widow approach and place two small copper coins—worth only a fraction of a penny—into the collection. Calling his disciples aside, Jesus declared, “I tell you the truth, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others. They all gave out of their wealth, but she, out of her poverty, put in everything—all she had to live on.”

As Jesus departed the temple, several of his disciples remarked upon its impressive stones and magnificent buildings. One disciple exclaimed, “Look, Teacher! What massive stones! What magnificent buildings!” Jesus responded, “Do you see all these great buildings?” and then declared, “Not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down.”

As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, opposite the temple, the disciples—including Peter, James, John, and Andrew—approached him privately. They questioned him earnestly, asking, “Teacher, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are all about to be fulfilled?”

Jesus repeatedly warned his followers to be vigilant against deception, stating that many would come in his name, falsely claiming to be “the Christ,” “he,” or proclaiming “the time is near,” all with the intention of misleading and deceiving others.

As you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed, for such events must occur before the end, marked by the rise of nations against nations and kingdoms, alongside famines and earthquakes as “birth pains.” You will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and hated by all nations because of this, facing trials before local councils, synagogues, governors, and kings as witnesses. Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child, with widespread hatred directed toward you, yet those who remain steadfast to the end will be saved. The gospel of the kingdom must be preached to all nations, and despite potential betrayals by family and friends, not a hair of your head will perish, for by standing firm you will gain eternal life.

When one observes Jerusalem being surrounded by armies, signifying the near desolation foretold, those residing in Judea must immediately flee to the mountains, while those within the city and country should evacuate.  No one should descend from a roof or enter a house to retrieve possessions, nor should anyone return to a field for their cloak. This impending disaster, described as “the abomination that causes desolation” standing where it does not belong, will bring unparalleled distress to the land, exceeding anything experienced since the creation of the world and never to be matched again.  Pregnant women and nursing mothers will face particularly horrific circumstances, and prayer is urged to avoid such a flight occurring during winter or on the Sabbath, as these times would amplify the suffering.  If these days had not been shortened by the Lord for the sake of the elect, no one would survive, yet the duration has been curtailed to preserve those chosen by God.

If anyone claims to present the Christ or indicates his location—whether in the desert or within inner rooms—do not believe them. False Christs and false prophets will emerge, performing great signs and miracles designed to deceive even the most devout. As lightning flashing from the east is visible in the west, so too will be the coming of the Son of Man. Be vigilant and remember that I have forewarned you of this deception ahead of time.

Wherever there is a carcass, there the vultures will gather.

Following a period of intense distress, a cataclysmic event will unfold marked by the darkening of the sun, the moon’s inability to shine, the falling of stars, and the shaking of the heavenly bodies. At that time, men will witness the appearance of the Son of Man in the sky, coming in clouds with great power and glory, and he will send his angels to gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other. Simultaneously, nations across the earth will experience anguish and perplexity, witnessing the roaring and tossing of the sea, and men will faint from terror, apprehensive of the impending global upheaval, as the heavenly bodies themselves are shaken.  As these events begin, individuals are instructed to stand and lift up their heads, recognizing that their redemption is drawing near.

Using the fig tree as a lesson, the speaker instructed his audience to observe the tender twigs and emerging leaves as a sign that summer, and by extension, a significant event, was approaching, “right at the door.” He emphasized that this generation would not pass away until these signs manifested, stating that “heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away,” and further clarified that the appearance of these signs – like the fig tree’s growth – indicated the nearness of the kingdom of God.

According to biblical teachings, no one, including the angels in heaven and the Son, possesses knowledge of the specific day or hour of a future event; this knowledge is exclusively held by the Father.

As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark; and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.

Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left. Two women will be grinding with a hand mill; one will be taken and the other left. "Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come. But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into.

Be on guard and remain alert, for the Son of Man will return at an unexpected hour, like a master returning suddenly to his household. You do not know when this time will come, and to prepare, you should be like a faithful and wise servant entrusted with the care of others, ensuring they are fed at the proper time. However, if a servant is found neglecting this duty, indulging in dissipation, drunkenness, and harming his fellow servants, the master will return unexpectedly and inflict a severe punishment—cutting him into pieces and assigning him a place with the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. This judgment will fall upon all who live on the face of the earth, so be careful and pray for the strength to escape all that is about to happen and stand before the Son of Man.

"At that time the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were foolish and five were wise. The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take any oil with them. The wise, however, took oil in jars along with their lamps. The bridegroom was a long time in coming, and they all became drowsy and fell asleep. "At midnight the cry rang out: 'Here's the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!' "Then all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps. The foolish ones said to the wise, 'Give us some of your oil; our lamps are going out.' "'No,' they replied, 'there may not be enough for both us and you. Instead, go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.' "But while they were on their way to buy the oil, the bridegroom arrived. The virgins who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet. And the door was shut. "Later the others also came. 'Sir! Sir!' they said. 'Open the door for us!' "But he replied, 'I tell you the truth, I don't know you.' "Therefore keep watch, because you do not know the day or the hour.

"Again, it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted his property to them. To one he gave five talents of money, to another two talents, and to another one talent, each according to his ability. Then he went on his journey. The man who had received the five talents went at once and put his money to work and gained five more. So also, the one with the two talents gained two more. But the man who had received the one talent went off, dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money. "After a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them. The man who had received the five talents brought the other five. 'Master,' he said, 'you entrusted me with five talents. See, I have gained five more.' "His master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!' "The man with the two talents also came. 'Master,' he said, 'you entrusted me with two talents; see, I have gained two more.' "His master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!' "Then the man who had received the one talent came. 'Master,' he said, 'I knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed. So I was afraid and went out and hid your talent in the ground. See, here is what belongs to you.' "His master replied, 'You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed? Well then, you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers, so that when I returned I would have received it back with interest. "'Take the talent from him and give it to the one who has the ten talents. For everyone who has will be given more, and he will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him. And throw that worthless servant outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'

"When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his throne in heavenly glory. All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left. "Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.' "Then the righteous will answer him, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?' "The King will reply, 'I tell you the truth, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me.' "Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.' "They also will answer, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?' "He will reply, 'I tell you the truth, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.' "Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life."

Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the Feast. They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request. "Sir," they said, "we would like to see Jesus." Philip went to tell Andrew; Andrew and Philip in turn told Jesus. Jesus replied, "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. I tell you the truth, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds. The man who loves his life will lose it, while the man who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. Whoever serves me must follow me; and where I am, my servant also will be. My Father will honor the one who serves me. "Now my heart is troubled, and what shall I say? 'Father, save me from this hour'? No, it was for this very reason I came to this hour. Father, glorify your name!" Then a voice came from heaven, "I have glorified it, and will glorify it again." The crowd that was there and heard it said it had thundered; others said an angel had spoken to him. Jesus said, "This voice was for your benefit, not mine. Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this world will be driven out. But I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself." He said this to show the kind of death he was going to die. The crowd spoke up, "We have heard from the Law that the Christ will remain forever, so how can you say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this 'Son of Man'?" Then Jesus told them, "You are going to have the light just a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, before darkness overtakes you. The man who walks in the dark does not know where he is going. Put your trust in the light while you have it, so that you may become sons of light." When he had finished speaking, Jesus left and hid himself from them.

When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he said to his disciples, "As you know, the Passover is two days away--and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified."

As the Feast of Unleavened Bread, or Passover, approached just two days later, the chief priests and elders of the people, including the high priest Caiaphas, assembled in the palace of the high priest and plotted to arrest Jesus and kill him. They were acutely aware of the potential for unrest among the populace and specifically avoided planning the act during the Feast, fearing a riot if their intentions were discovered. Driven by a fear of the people’s reaction, they sought a clandestine method to eliminate Jesus.

Satan entered Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, and he then approached the chief priests and the officers of the temple guard, discussing with them his plan to betray Jesus. The priests were delighted with the proposition and promised him thirty silver coins, which Judas eagerly accepted. From that point forward, Judas watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them, carefully observing for a time when a crowd was not present.

Even after Jesus had done all these miraculous signs in their presence, they still would not believe in him. This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet: "Lord, who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?" For this reason they could not believe, because, as Isaiah says elsewhere: "He has blinded their eyes and deadened their hearts, so they can neither see with their eyes, nor understand with their hearts, nor turn--and I would heal them." Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus' glory and spoke about him. Yet at the same time many even among the leaders believed in him. But because of the Pharisees they would not confess their faith for fear they would be put out of the synagogue; for they loved praise from men more than praise from God.

Then Jesus cried out, "When a man believes in me, he does not believe in me only, but in the one who sent me. When he looks at me, he sees the one who sent me. I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in me should stay in darkness. "As for the person who hears my words but does not keep them, I do not judge him. For I did not come to judge the world, but to save it. There is a judge for the one who rejects me and does not accept my words; that very word which I spoke will condemn him at the last day. For I did not speak of my own accord, but the Father who sent me commanded me what to say and how to say it. I know that his command leads to eternal life. So whatever I say is just what the Father has told me to say."

On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover lamb was to be sacrificed, Jesus’ disciples inquired where they should prepare for the Passover meal. He instructed them to send two disciples into the city to locate a man carrying a jar of water, whom they were to follow and direct to a house. Upon entering, they were to ask the owner for the guest room, stating, “The Teacher asks: Where is my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?” The owner would then reveal a large, furnished upper room, and the disciples were to make preparations there, as Jesus had directed.

When the hour came, Jesus arrived with the Twelve and, as evening descended, he was reclining at the table with them, sharing a meal with his apostles.

And he said to them, "I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it finds fulfillment in the kingdom of God."

It was just before the Passover Feast. Jesus knew that the time had come for him to leave this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he now showed them the full extent of his love. The evening meal was being served, and the devil had already prompted Judas Iscariot, son of Simon, to betray Jesus. Jesus knew that the Father had put all things under his power, and that he had come from God and was returning to God; so he got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around his waist. After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples' feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him. He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, "Lord, are you going to wash my feet?" Jesus replied, "You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand." "No," said Peter, "you shall never wash my feet." Jesus answered, "Unless I wash you, you have no part with me." "Then, Lord," Simon Peter replied, "not just my feet but my hands and my head as well!" Jesus answered, "A person who has had a bath needs only to wash his feet; his whole body is clean. And you are clean, though not every one of you." For he knew who was going to betray him, and that was why he said not every one was clean. When he had finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and returned to his place. "Do you understand what I have done for you?" he asked them. "You call me 'Teacher' and 'Lord,' and rightly so, for that is what I am. Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another's feet. I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you. I tell you the truth, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him. Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.

As they reclined at the table and were eating, Jesus repeatedly declared that one of them would betray him, stating, “I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me—one who is eating with me.” He then revealed that the hand of the betrayer was resting upon his own on the table, warning that woe would befall the man who committed the act. Jesus clarified that he was not speaking of all present, but specifically of those he had chosen, referencing scripture – “He who shares my bread has lifted up his heel against me” – and explaining that this betrayal was predetermined and intended to fulfill prophecy, asserting that accepting anyone he sent was accepting himself, and accepting him accepting the one who sent him. Troubled by this impending betrayal, Jesus reiterated his warning, “I tell you the truth, one of you is going to betray me.”

As Jesus spoke of impending betrayal, his disciples were overcome with sadness and began to question among themselves which of them it might be. One by one, they vehemently denied involvement, stating “Surely not I, Lord?” Jesus responded, “The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me,” and affirmed that the Son of Man would fulfill prophecy. He warned woe upon the betrayer, stating it would be better for him if he had not been born. When Judas, the one destined to betray him, declared “Surely not I, Rabbi?” Jesus directly replied, “Yes, it is you.”  The disciples, bewildered and unable to understand his meaning, stared at one another in confusion, while Simon Peter, seeking clarification, gestured to the disciple reclining beside Jesus and asked, “Lord, who is it?”

Jesus answered, "It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish." Then, dipping the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, son of Simon. As soon as Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him.

"What you are about to do, do quickly," Jesus told him, but no one at the meal understood why Jesus said this to him. Since Judas had charge of the money, some thought Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the Feast, or to give something to the poor. As soon as Judas had taken the bread, he went out. And it was night.

When he was gone, Jesus said, "Now is the Son of Man glorified and God is glorified in him. If God is glorified in him, God will glorify the Son in himself, and will glorify him at once. "My children, I will be with you only a little longer. You will look for me, and just as I told the Jews, so I tell you now: Where I am going, you cannot come. "A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another."

While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, “Take and eat; this is my body.” He then explained that this act was to be done in remembrance of him.

After the supper, Jesus took the cup, gave thanks, and offered it to his disciples, saying, “Drink from it, all of you. This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.” He then repeated this declaration as they all drank from the cup, emphasizing that it represented the new covenant established through his blood, poured out for them.

After taking the cup, Jesus gave thanks and distributed it among his disciples. He then declared, “I tell you I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it anew in the kingdom of God.” This statement echoed the sentiments expressed by both Peter and John, who affirmed their intention to abstain from the fruit of the vine until they shared in that same experience with him in the Father’s kingdom.

Also a dispute arose among them as to which of them was considered to be greatest. Jesus said to them, "The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those who exercise authority over them call themselves Benefactors. But you are not to be like that. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who rules like the one who serves. For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who is at the table? But I am among you as one who serves. You are those who have stood by me in my trials. And I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred one on me, so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

As Jesus spoke of being sifted like wheat, Simon Peter, initially responding with fervent devotion, declared his readiness to accompany Jesus to prison or even death. Jesus then prophesied that Peter would deny him three times before the rooster crowed, a statement that deeply troubled the apostle, who questioned why he couldn’t follow Jesus immediately and offered to lay down his life for him.  Jesus, reaffirming his prediction, stated unequivocally that Peter would disown him three times before the rooster’s crow.

"Do not let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God; trust also in me. In my Father's house are many rooms; if it were not so, I would have told you. I am going there to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am. You know the way to the place where I am going." Thomas said to him, "Lord, we don't know where you are going, so how can we know the way?" Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. If you really knew me, you would know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him." Philip said, "Lord, show us the Father and that will be enough for us." Jesus answered: "Don't you know me, Philip, even after I have been among you such a long time? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, 'Show us the Father'? Don't you believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words I say to you are not just my own. Rather, it is the Father, living in me, who is doing his work. Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; or at least believe on the evidence of the miracles themselves. I tell you the truth, anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing. He will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father. And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Son may bring glory to the Father. You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.

"If you love me, you will obey what I command. And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Counselor to be with you forever-- the Spirit of truth. The world cannot accept him, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be in you. I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you. Before long, the world will not see me anymore, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live. On that day you will realize that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you. Whoever has my commands and obeys them, he is the one who loves me. He who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I too will love him and show myself to him." Then Judas (not Judas Iscariot) said, "But, Lord, why do you intend to show yourself to us and not to the world?" Jesus replied, "If anyone loves me, he will obey my teaching. My Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him. He who does not love me will not obey my teaching. These words you hear are not my own; they belong to the Father who sent me. "All this I have spoken while still with you. But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you. Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid. "You heard me say, 'I am going away and I am coming back to you.' If you loved me, you would be glad that I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I. I have told you now before it happens, so that when it does happen you will believe. I will not speak with you much longer, for the prince of this world is coming. He has no hold on me, but the world must learn that I love the Father and that I do exactly what my Father has commanded me.

Then Jesus asked them, "When I sent you without purse, bag or sandals, did you lack anything?Nothing," they answered. He said to them, "But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one. It is written: 'And he was numbered with the transgressors'; and I tell you that this must be fulfilled in me. Yes, what is written about me is reaching its fulfillment." The disciples said, "See, Lord, here are two swords.That is enough," he replied.

After they had sung a hymn, Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and his disciples followed him. As they walked, Jesus said, “Come now; let us leave.”

That evening, Jesus foretold the imminent abandonment of all the disciples, citing scripture about the shepherd being struck and the flock scattered, and promising to precede them into Galilee after his resurrection. Peter vehemently denied this, stating he would never disown Jesus, even if all others did. Jesus responded, stating that Peter would indeed deny him three times that very night, before the rooster crows twice, and warned him to watch and weep for his soul was in danger.  All the other disciples echoed Peter’s unwavering loyalty, affirming their commitment to remain with him, regardless of the impending betrayal.

"I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener. He cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit, while every branch that does bear fruit he prunes so that it will be even more fruitful. You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you. Remain in me, and I will remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me. "I am the vine; you are the branches. If a man remains in me and I in him, he will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing. If anyone does not remain in me, he is like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned. If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be given you. This is to my Father's glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples. "As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Now remain in my love. If you obey my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have obeyed my Father's commands and remain in his love. I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete. My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends. You are my friends if you do what I command. I no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know his master's business. Instead, I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you. You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit--fruit that will last. Then the Father will give you whatever you ask in my name. This is my command: Love each other.

"If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you. Remember the words I spoke to you: 'No servant is greater than his master.' If they persecuted me, they will persecute you also. If they obeyed my teaching, they will obey yours also. They will treat you this way because of my name, for they do not know the One who sent me. If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin. Now, however, they have no excuse for their sin. He who hates me hates my Father as well. If I had not done among them what no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin. But now they have seen these miracles, and yet they have hated both me and my Father. But this is to fulfill what is written in their Law: 'They hated me without reason.' "When the Counselor comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father, he will testify about me. And you also must testify, for you have been with me from the beginning. "All this I have told you so that you will not go astray. They will put you out of the synagogue; in fact, a time is coming when anyone who kills you will think he is offering a service to God. They will do such things because they have not known the Father or me. I have told you this, so that when the time comes you will remember that I warned you. I did not tell you this at first because I was with you.

"Now I am going to him who sent me, yet none of you asks me, 'Where are you going?' Because I have said these things, you are filled with grief. But I tell you the truth: It is for your good that I am going away. Unless I go away, the Counselor will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you. When he comes, he will convict the world of guilt in regard to sin and righteousness and judgment: in regard to sin, because men do not believe in me; in regard to righteousness, because I am going to the Father, where you can see me no longer; and in regard to judgment, because the prince of this world now stands condemned. "I have much more to say to you, more than you can now bear. But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to come. He will bring glory to me by taking from what is mine and making it known to you. All that belongs to the Father is mine. That is why I said the Spirit will take from what is mine and make it known to you.

"In a little while you will see me no more, and then after a little while you will see me." Some of his disciples said to one another, "What does he mean by saying, 'In a little while you will see me no more, and then after a little while you will see me,' and 'Because I am going to the Father'?" They kept asking, "What does he mean by 'a little while'? We don't understand what he is saying." Jesus saw that they wanted to ask him about this, so he said to them, "Are you asking one another what I meant when I said, 'In a little while you will see me no more, and then after a little while you will see me'? I tell you the truth, you will weep and mourn while the world rejoices. You will grieve, but your grief will turn to joy. A woman giving birth to a child has pain because her time has come; but when her baby is born she forgets the anguish because of her joy that a child is born into the world. So with you: Now is your time of grief, but I will see you again and you will rejoice, and no one will take away your joy. In that day you will no longer ask me anything. I tell you the truth, my Father will give you whatever you ask in my name. Until now you have not asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive, and your joy will be complete.

"Though I have been speaking figuratively, a time is coming when I will no longer use this kind of language but will tell you plainly about my Father. In that day you will ask in my name. I am not saying that I will ask the Father on your behalf. No, the Father himself loves you because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God. I came from the Father and entered the world; now I am leaving the world and going back to the Father." Then Jesus' disciples said, "Now you are speaking clearly and without figures of speech. Now we can see that you know all things and that you do not even need to have anyone ask you questions. This makes us believe that you came from God." "You believe at last!" Jesus answered. "But a time is coming, and has come, when you will be scattered, each to his own home. You will leave me all alone. Yet I am not alone, for my Father is with me. "I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world."

After Jesus said this, he looked toward heaven and prayed: "Father, the time has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son may glorify you. For you granted him authority over all people that he might give eternal life to all those you have given him. Now this is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent. I have brought you glory on earth by completing the work you gave me to do. And now, Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began. "I have revealed you to those whom you gave me out of the world. They were yours; you gave them to me and they have obeyed your word. Now they know that everything you have given me comes from you. For I gave them the words you gave me and they accepted them. They knew with certainty that I came from you, and they believed that you sent me. I pray for them. I am not praying for the world, but for those you have given me, for they are yours. All I have is yours, and all you have is mine. And glory has come to me through them. I will remain in the world no longer, but they are still in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, protect them by the power of your name--the name you gave me--so that they may be one as we are one. While I was with them, I protected them and kept them safe by that name you gave me. None has been lost except the one doomed to destruction so that Scripture would be fulfilled. "I am coming to you now, but I say these things while I am still in the world, so that they may have the full measure of my joy within them. I have given them your word and the world has hated them, for they are not of the world any more than I am of the world. My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one. They are not of the world, even as I am not of it. Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth. As you sent me into the world, I have sent them into the world. For them I sanctify myself, that they too may be truly sanctified. "My prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message, that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me. I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one: I in them and you in me. May they be brought to complete unity to let the world know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me. "Father, I want those you have given me to be with me where I am, and to see my glory, the glory you have given me because you loved me before the creation of the world. "Righteous Father, though the world does not know you, I know you, and they know that you have sent me. I have made you known to them, and will continue to make you known in order that the love you have for me may be in them and that I myself may be in them."

Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, where he instructed them to sit while he went to pray. He took Peter, James, and John with him, and as he began to be deeply distressed and troubled, confessing that his soul was overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death, he urged them to stay and keep watch. Before beginning his prayer, Jesus also asked them to pray that they would not fall into temptation. Following his prayer, Jesus left with his disciples and crossed the Kidron Valley, eventually entering an olive grove on the other side.

Going a little farther, Jesus fell to the ground and prayed, “Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will.” He withdrew a stone’s throw beyond his disciples, knelt down, and repeated this plea, “Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done.” An angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him, and in his anguish, he prayed even more earnestly, his sweat becoming like drops of blood falling to the ground. Upon rising from prayer, he returned to find his disciples asleep, exhausted from sorrow.

Jesus returned to his disciples and found them sleeping, prompting him to question Peter, “Simon, are you asleep? Could you not keep watch for one hour? Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the body is weak.” He then went away a second time to pray, repeating his plea to his Father, “My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it, may your will be done.”

When Jesus returned for the third time, he found the disciples still sleeping, their eyes heavy with weariness. He questioned them, “Are you still sleeping and resting?” and, finding them unresponsive, declared, “Enough! The hour has come. Look, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!”

While Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived with a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders. Judas had arranged a signal with this group: “The one I kiss is the man; arrest him and lead him away under guard.” Approaching Jesus, Judas greeted him as “Rabbi!” and kissed him. Jesus, recognizing the betrayal, responded with “Friend, do what you came for.”  Judas, knowing the location due to Jesus’s frequent meetings with his disciples, led a detachment of soldiers and officials from the chief priests and Pharisees, who carried torches, lanterns, and weapons, to the grove where Jesus was.

Jesus, knowing all that was going to happen to him, went out and asked them, "Who is it you want?" "Jesus of Nazareth," they replied. "I am he," Jesus said. (And Judas the traitor was standing there with them.) When Jesus said, "I am he," they drew back and fell to the ground. Again he asked them, "Who is it you want?" And they said, "Jesus of Nazareth." "I told you that I am he," Jesus answered. "If you are looking for me, then let these men go." This happened so that the words he had spoken would be fulfilled: "I have not lost one of those you gave me."

As the men seized Jesus and arrested him, one of Jesus’ companions, followed by others, drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, Malchus, cutting off his right ear.  Peter, also present, drew his own sword in an attempt to intervene, striking the servant as well.  Jesus immediately intervened, commanding Peter to put away his sword and heal the servant’s ear, stating, “No more of this!”  He then further cautioned all those present, declaring that those who drew swords would die by the sword and referencing scripture to explain how events were unfolding as planned.

As Jesus questioned, “Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me?” he recounted that he had been teaching daily in the temple courts, yet they had never attempted to arrest him. He then stated, “But this has all taken place that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled,” and as he spoke, all the disciples deserted him and fled.  Later, addressing the chief priests, the officers of the temple guard, and the elders, Jesus repeated his inquiry, “Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come with swords and clubs?” emphasizing his consistent presence and lack of prior resistance, before declaring, “But this is your hour—when darkness reigns.”

Then, after everyone deserted him and fled, the detachment of soldiers, led by their commander and accompanied by Jewish officials, arrested Jesus. They bound him and took him away.

A young man, wearing nothing but a linen garment, was following Jesus. When they seized him, he fled naked, leaving his garment behind.

Following his arrest, Jesus was taken to Caiaphas, the high priest, where a gathering of the chief priests, elders, and teachers of the law had assembled. Those responsible for his capture then led him away, bringing him into the house of the high priest.

and brought him first to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year. Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jews that it would be good if one man died for the people.

Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus when they entered the courtyard of the high priest. Peter, however, was initially kept outside the gate, while the other disciple, known to the high priest, went inside and brought Peter in, where he joined the guards and sat down to observe the unfolding events, warming himself by the fire. Peter followed at a distance throughout this process, remaining close to the courtyard entrance.

While Peter was in the courtyard, a servant girl approached him, initially stating, “You also were with Jesus of Galilee,” to which he vehemently denied knowing her. Later, another servant girl, while Peter was warming himself by a fire kindled by the high priest’s servants, observed him closely and declared, “This man was with him.” Peter repeatedly denied any association with Jesus, responding with “Woman, I don’t know him,” despite being present with the others around the fire, as confirmed by a subsequent inquiry: “You are not one of his disciples, are you?” He again denied any connection to Jesus of Nazareth.

"I don't know or understand what you're talking about," he said, and went out into the entryway.

Meanwhile, the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching. "I have spoken openly to the world," Jesus replied. "I always taught in synagogues or at the temple, where all the Jews come together. I said nothing in secret. Why question me? Ask those who heard me. Surely they know what I said." When Jesus said this, one of the officials nearby struck him in the face. "Is this the way you answer the high priest?" he demanded. "If I said something wrong," Jesus replied, "testify as to what is wrong. But if I spoke the truth, why did you strike me?" Then Annas sent him, still bound, to Caiaphas the high priest.

The chief priests and the entire Sanhedrin sought false evidence to condemn Jesus, yet despite numerous false witnesses presenting conflicting accounts—namely, that he would destroy and rebuild the temple in three days—they found no concrete proof. Finally, two men stepped forward, claiming Jesus had uttered this blasphemous statement. The high priest then demanded an answer from Jesus, questioning him under oath as the Son of God, to which Jesus replied, “I am,” and prophesied his future appearance as the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.  Upon hearing this, the high priest tore his clothes, declaring, “You have heard the blasphemy; what do you think? He is worthy of death,” and concluding that further witnesses were unnecessary.

As Jesus was being guarded, the men in charge began mocking and beating him, blindfolding him and demanding he prophesy, repeatedly asking “Who hit you?” Others joined in the assault, slapping him and shouting for him to prophesy, while simultaneously condemning him as worthy of death. The guards intensified the abuse, spitting at him and striking him with their fists, adding to the chorus of insults and demands for a prophecy.

As Simon Peter warmed himself, he was repeatedly questioned about his association with a particular individual. Initially, when a servant girl observed him present, she declared he was “one of them,” and Peter vehemently denied it. Later, another person identified him similarly, stating “You also are one of them,” to which Peter responded, “I am not!” He continued to deny any connection, repeating his denial with an oath: “I don’t know the man!”

After a short period, several individuals questioned Peter, asserting that his Galilean accent identified him as one of Jesus’ followers. Peter vehemently denied any knowledge of Jesus, calling down curses upon himself and swearing he didn’t know the man they were referring to. Approximately an hour later, another person insisted Peter had been with Jesus in the olive grove, further fueling the accusations.  Peter again denied the claim, and just as he spoke, a rooster crowed, signaling his denial once more.  Subsequently, a servant of the high priest, a relative of the man Peter had wounded, confronted him about having seen him with Jesus in the olive grove, prompting Peter to deny it again, and culminating in the crowing of a rooster.

Immediately the rooster crowed the second time.

Immediately, a rooster crowed, and Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken: “Before the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times.” The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter, confirming the prophecy, and Peter, overcome with dread, went outside and wept bitterly.

Very early in the morning, the chief priests, along with the elders, teachers of the law, and the entire Sanhedrin, reached a decision to put Jesus to death. At daybreak, the council of the elders of the people, including the chief priests and teachers of the law, met together and led Jesus before them. They questioned him, demanding he declare himself, stating, “If you are the Christ, tell us.” Jesus responded that they would not believe him, and they would not answer his questions. He then proclaimed, “From now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty God.” When they pressed him further, asking, “Are you then the Son of God?”, he affirmed, “You are right in saying I am.” Convinced by his own words, the council declared they no longer needed any further testimony.

When Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he was seized with remorse and returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and the elders. "I have sinned," he said, "for I have betrayed innocent blood.What is that to us?" they replied. "That's your responsibility." So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself. The chief priests picked up the coins and said, "It is against the law to put this into the treasury, since it is blood money." So they decided to use the money to buy the potter's field as a burial place for foreigners. That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day. Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: "They took the thirty silver coins, the price set on him by the people of Israel, and they used them to buy the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me."

Following his arrest, Jesus was bound and led away, first by a group who handed him over to Pilate, the Roman governor, and then by the entire assembly who rose and continued to accuse him of subverting the nation and claiming to be a king. The Jews, originating from Caiaphas, escorted Jesus to the palace of the Roman governor, arriving early morning and avoiding entry to avoid ceremonial uncleanness for the Passover. Pilate emerged and inquired about the charges against Jesus, but the Jews insisted he was not a criminal and should be judged by their own law. Despite their objections that they had no right to execute him, the Jews maintained their accusations, driven by a desire for the fulfillment of Jesus’s prophecies regarding his impending death.

As Jesus stood before the Roman governor, Pontius Pilate, he was repeatedly questioned about his kingship, first with “Are you the king of the Jews?” to which Jesus affirmed, “Yes, it is as you say.” Accused by the chief priests and elders of numerous offenses, Jesus consistently refused to answer any of the charges brought against him, astonishing Pilate, who inquired repeatedly if he would respond to the accusations. Despite the overwhelming evidence presented, Pilate declared he found no basis for a charge, announcing this to both the chief priests and the crowd.  Jesus then engaged Pilate in a dialogue, questioning the source of the accusation, asserting his kingdom was not of this world, and ultimately stating his purpose was to testify to the truth, prompting Pilate to concede he was indeed a king, leading the governor to further question “What is truth?” before returning to the Jewish leaders and reiterating his lack of grounds for condemnation.

But they insisted, "He stirs up the people all over Judea by his teaching. He started in Galilee and has come all the way here." On hearing this, Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean. When he learned that Jesus was under Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time. When Herod saw Jesus, he was greatly pleased, because for a long time he had been wanting to see him. From what he had heard about him, he hoped to see him perform some miracle. He plied him with many questions, but Jesus gave him no answer. The chief priests and the teachers of the law were standing there, vehemently accusing him. Then Herod and his soldiers ridiculed and mocked him. Dressing him in an elegant robe, they sent him back to Pilate. That day Herod and Pilate became friends--before this they had been enemies.

While Pilate was sitting on the judge's seat, his wife sent him this message: "Don't have anything to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him."

Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers and the people, and said to them, "You brought me this man as one who was inciting the people to rebellion. I have examined him in your presence and have found no basis for your charges against him. Neither has Herod, for he sent him back to us; as you can see, he has done nothing to deserve death. Therefore, I will punish him and then release him."

It was the governor’s established custom at the Feast to release a prisoner chosen by the crowd. A notorious prisoner named Barabbas was held in custody, alongside insurrectionists who had committed murder during the uprising. When the crowd gathered, Pilate was asked which prisoner they desired him to release – Barabbas or Jesus, who was called Christ. Pilate, aware that the request stemmed from envy fueled by the chief priests’ actions, posed the question, “Do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews?” This followed the established practice of releasing one prisoner at the time of the Passover.

The chief priests and elders, seeking to avoid Jesus’s execution, skillfully persuaded the crowd to demand the release of Barabbas, a prisoner thrown into jail for an insurrection and murder.  The governor, presented with the choice, was met with a unified chorus of “Away with this man! Release Barabbas to us!”  The crowd, stirred by the priests, vehemently rejected Jesus and cried out for Barabbas’s freedom, repeating their demand, “No, not him! Give us Barabbas!”

Pilate, repeatedly questioning the crowd regarding Jesus, who was variously referred to as “Jesus who is called Christ” and “the king of the Jews,” consistently received the demand to “Crucify him!” He inquired repeatedly about the crime Jesus had committed, yet the crowd responded with increasingly fervent shouts of “Crucify him!” Despite Pilate’s desire to release Jesus, finding no grounds for the death penalty, the crowd’s insistent and overwhelming demands for crucifixion ultimately prevailed.

Following his arrest, the governor’s soldiers led Jesus into the Praetorium, gathering a company of soldiers around him. They stripped him and clothed him in a purple robe, then twisted together a crown of thorns and placed it upon his head. The soldiers repeatedly called out “Hail, king of the Jews!” while striking him with a staff and spitting upon him, and, falling to their knees, they paid him homage. Subsequently, Pilate had Jesus flogged, and the soldiers once again twisted a crown of thorns, placing it on his head and continuing to proclaim “Hail, king of the Jews!” while striking him in the face.

Once more Pilate came out and said to the Jews, "Look, I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against him." When Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate said to them, "Here is the man!" As soon as the chief priests and their officials saw him, they shouted, "Crucify! Crucify!" But Pilate answered, "You take him and crucify him. As for me, I find no basis for a charge against him." The Jews insisted, "We have a law, and according to that law he must die, because he claimed to be the Son of God." When Pilate heard this, he was even more afraid, and he went back inside the palace. "Where do you come from?" he asked Jesus, but Jesus gave him no answer. "Do you refuse to speak to me?" Pilate said. "Don't you realize I have power either to free you or to crucify you?" Jesus answered, "You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin." From then on, Pilate tried to set Jesus free, but the Jews kept shouting, "If you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar." When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge's seat at a place known as the Stone Pavement (which in Aramaic is Gabbatha). It was the day of Preparation of Passover Week, about the sixth hour. "Here is your king," Pilate said to the Jews. But they shouted, "Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him!Shall I crucify your king?" Pilate asked. "We have no king but Caesar," the chief priests answered.

When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. "I am innocent of this man's blood," he said. "It is your responsibility!" All the people answered, "Let his blood be on us and on our children!"

Wanting to appease a demanding crowd, Pontius Pilate released Barabbas, the man imprisoned for insurrection and murder, fulfilling their request. Simultaneously, he ordered Jesus to be flogged and then surrendered him to their will, ultimately deciding to hand him over for crucifixion.

After being subjected to mockery, the soldiers removed the purple robe from Jesus and replaced it with his own clothes. They then took him out to be crucified, carrying his own cross to the place of the Skull, known as Golgotha in Aramaic.

As they were proceeding, they encountered Simon, a man from Cyrene, who was passing by on his way in from the country and the father of Alexander and Rufus. They forcibly compelled him to carry the cross, seizing him as they led him away and placing it upon his shoulders, making him carry it behind Jesus.

A large number of people followed him, including women who mourned and wailed for him. Jesus turned and said to them, "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; weep for yourselves and for your children. For the time will come when you will say, 'Blessed are the barren women, the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!' Then "'they will say to the mountains, "Fall on us!" and to the hills, "Cover us!"' For if men do these things when the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?"

They brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha, which meant “The Place of the Skull.” After being crucified, they divided his clothes by casting lots. They offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he refused to drink it.  Alongside Jesus, they also crucified two other criminals, one on his right and the other on his left, with Jesus positioned in the center.

Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing." And they divided up his clothes by casting lots.

After Jesus was crucified by the soldiers, they sat down and kept watch over his body. Following this, they divided up his clothes, casting lots to determine who would receive each portion; they ultimately distributed the garments among themselves, taking four shares, with the seamless undergarment remaining. Recognizing its unique quality, they agreed not to tear it, instead deciding to divide it by lot as well, ensuring that a prophecy would be fulfilled: “They divided my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing.”

It was the third hour when they crucified him.

Above Jesus’ head, a written charge was affixed to the cross, initially stating “THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.” Later, the notice was revised to read “THE KING OF THE JEWS,” and then expanded to “JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.”  Pilate had a sign prepared in Aramaic, Latin, and Greek, fastened to the cross, detailing this title.  The chief priests vehemently objected, arguing that the sign should not declare Jesus as claiming to be king, but rather stating his claim.  Pilate, however, firmly refused to alter his written declaration, stating simply, “What I have written, I have written.”

Two other men, both criminals, were led out to be executed and crucified alongside him; one was positioned on his right and the other on his left. Two robbers were crucified with him in this manner.

As Jesus hung on the cross, a multitude of voices rose in derision. Those who passed by hurled insults, shaking their heads and proclaiming, “So! You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, come down from the cross and save yourself!” The chief priests, teachers of the law, and elders mocked him amongst themselves, repeating the accusation that he saved others but could not save himself, demanding that “this Christ, this King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe.” Even the robbers crucified alongside him joined in the jeers, further piling on the insults and questioning his claim as the “Christ of God, the Chosen One,” while the onlookers stood watching, adding their own sneers to the chorus of disbelief.

The soldiers also came up and mocked him. They offered him wine vinegar and said, "If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself."

One of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him: "Aren't you the Christ? Save yourself and us!" But the other criminal rebuked him. "Don't you fear God," he said, "since you are under the same sentence? We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong." Then he said, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom. " Jesus answered him, "I tell you the truth, today you will be with me in paradise."

Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus saw his mother there, and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, "Dear woman, here is your son," and to the disciple, "Here is your mother." From that time on, this disciple took her into his home.

It was approximately the sixth hour when darkness suddenly descended upon the entire land, persisting until the ninth hour. During this time, the sun ceased to shine, and a complete darkness enveloped everything.

At the ninth hour, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, “Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?”—which translates to “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”  As he spoke, some of those standing nearby heard his words and responded, saying, “Listen, he’s calling Elijah,” while others who were standing there claimed he was calling Elijah as well.

As the events unfolded, one man quickly ran to obtain a sponge, filling it with wine vinegar and attaching it to a stick. Later, recognizing that all was complete and desiring to fulfill a prophecy, Jesus expressed his thirst and requested to drink.  A jar of wine vinegar was then used to soak a sponge, which was placed on a stalk of hyssop and offered to Jesus’ lips.

“Now leave him alone,” they said, a chorus of voices urging retreat, “Let’s see if Elijah comes to save him.”  A moment later, a single voice countered, “Now leave him alone. Let’s see if Elijah comes to take him down,” signaling a different, potentially darker, expectation regarding the figure they were observing.

When he had received the drink, Jesus said, "It is finished." With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.

Jesus called out with a loud voice, "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit." When he had said this, he breathed his last.

And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit. With a loud cry, Jesus breathed his last.

The curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom, accompanied by a violent shaking of the earth and the splitting of the rocks. Simultaneously, the tombs broke open, releasing the bodies of many holy people who had died, raising them to life and causing them to emerge and proceed into the holy city, where they appeared to numerous people, mirroring the events following Jesus’ resurrection.

When the centurion and those guarding Jesus witnessed the earthquake and the events surrounding his death, they were overcome with terror and exclaimed, “Surely he was the Son of God!” Hearing Jesus’ final cry and observing his demise, the centurion himself declared, “Surely this man was the Son of God!” Following this, upon seeing the totality of what had transpired, the centurion praised God and affirmed that this was a righteous man.

When all the people who had gathered to witness this sight saw what took place, they beat their breasts and went away.

Following Jesus from Galilee, a group of women diligently cared for his needs, including Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee’s sons.  Many other women, some having traveled up to Jerusalem with him, were also present, and from a distance, numerous women watched as these events unfolded, with those who knew Jesus personally among them.

Now it was the day of Preparation, and the next day was to be a special Sabbath. Because the Jews did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the Sabbath, they asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down. The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus, and then those of the other. But when they came to Jesus and found that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. Instead, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus' side with a spear, bringing a sudden flow of blood and water. The man who saw it has given testimony, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, and he testifies so that you also may believe. These things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled: "Not one of his bones will be broken," and, as another scripture says, "They will look on the one they have pierced."

As Preparation Day drew to a close, Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the Council and a man waiting for the kingdom of God from the Judean town of Arimathea, boldly approached Pilate and requested Jesus’ body. Initially surprised to learn that Jesus was already dead, Pilate summoned a centurion to confirm the news, whereupon he granted Joseph’s request. Joseph, a good and upright man who had not consented to the council’s decision, was also a disciple of Jesus, though he did so secretly due to his fear of the Jews, and with Pilate’s permission, he retrieved the body.

On Preparation Day, as the Sabbath was about to begin, Joseph, accompanied by Nicodemus who had previously visited Jesus at night and brought seventy-five pounds of myrrh and aloes, took Jesus’ body to a new tomb cut out of rock, one in which no one had yet been laid. Joseph wrapped the body in clean linen cloth, mixed with the spices brought by Nicodemus, following Jewish burial customs, and then rolled a large stone in front of the tomb’s entrance before departing.

Following Jesus from Galilee, Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses, along with other women, arrived at the tomb. They found Mary Magdalene and the other Mary sitting opposite the tomb, and together they observed where Jesus’ body had been laid, witnessing the careful arrangement within the tomb itself.

Then they went home and prepared spices and perfumes. But they rested on the Sabbath in obedience to the commandment.

The next day, the one after Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate. "Sir," they said, "we remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said, 'After three days I will rise again.' So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day. Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead. This last deception will be worse than the first." "Take a guard," Pilate answered. "Go, make the tomb as secure as you know how." So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard.

When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices so that they might go to anoint Jesus' body.

Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and discovered that the stone had been removed from the entrance. Shortly after, at dawn, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb. As they approached, they asked each other who would roll the stone away from the entrance. The women had previously taken the spices they had prepared, and upon arriving, they found the tomb empty.

There was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and, going to the tomb, rolled back the stone and sat on it. His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow. The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men.

When they looked up, they discovered that the large stone had been rolled away from the tomb, revealing its interior.

but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.

As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, which immediately alarmed them. While they were wondering about this unexpected figure, suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them.

Filled with fear, the women sought Jesus, who had been crucified, and were initially alarmed by an angel who reassured them, stating, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. He is not here; he has risen, just as he said.”  The angel instructed them to go to the place where he had been laid, echoing the message of another messenger who declared, “Don’t be alarmed,” and confirmed Jesus’ resurrection, adding, “He is not here. See the place where they laid him.”  Despite these assurances, the women continued to search, prompting the men to advise them, “Why do you look for the living among the dead?”

he has risen! Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee: 'The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.'" Then they remembered his words.

Following the resurrection, the angel instructed Mary Magdalene to quickly relay the message to Jesus’ disciples and Peter: “He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him,” and he affirmed that he had already delivered this instruction.

Trembling and bewildered, the women went out and fled from the tomb. They said nothing to anyone, because they were afraid.

So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples.

So she came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved, and said, "They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know where they have put him!"

Following the crucifixion, Peter and the other disciple began to run toward the tomb. The other disciple quickly outran Peter and arrived first, bending over to examine the strips of linen lying within, but he did not enter. Shortly after, Peter arrived and entered the tomb, observing both the linen strips and the burial cloth wrapped around Jesus’ head, which was folded neatly aside from the linen. Finally, the first disciple also entered, saw the evidence, and believed. Despite this, the disciples still lacked understanding from Scripture regarding Jesus’ resurrection. Afterward, they returned to their homes.

When Jesus rose early on the first day of the week, he first appeared to Mary Magdalene, whom he had previously freed from seven demons. Mary Magdalene, however, was distraught and stood weeping outside the tomb, where she encountered two angels seated at the head and foot of Jesus’s empty tomb. She explained to the angels that her Lord had been taken, and they inquired about her distress. Turning, she saw Jesus standing there, but mistook him for the gardener, asking him where he had been taken. Jesus, identifying himself as “Mary,” instructed her not to cling to him, as he was returning to the Father. He then commanded her to go to his brothers and inform them that he was returning to their Father and God.

Suddenly Jesus met them. "Greetings," he said. They came to him, clasped his feet and worshiped him. Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me."

While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened. When the chief priests had met with the elders and devised a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money, telling them, "You are to say, 'His disciples came during the night and stole him away while we were asleep.' If this report gets to the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble." So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. And this story has been widely circulated among the Jews to this very day.

Mary Magdalene rushed to the disciples, proclaiming, “I have seen the Lord!” She then relayed his words to them, alongside Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women who had been present at the tomb. Upon their return from the empty tomb, these women shared the astonishing news that Jesus was alive, but the disciples, including the Eleven, dismissed their accounts as nonsensical and refused to believe them, despite the women’s initial reports to those who had mourned with Jesus.

and saying, "It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon."

After Jesus’s appearance in a different form to two individuals walking in the country, two men, Cleopas and another unnamed companion, were traveling to the village of Emmaus, approximately seven miles from Jerusalem, and discussing the recent events surrounding Jesus’s death. As they walked and debated, Jesus himself joined them, walking alongside them unnoticed. He inquired about their conversation, and they, with downcast faces, explained that they were lamenting the failure of Jesus of Nazareth, a prophet who had spoken powerfully before God and the people, to be the redeemer of Israel, recalling his arrest, trial, and crucifixion. They also recounted the women’s report of finding the empty tomb and a vision of angels confirming his resurrection, though their companions had found the tomb undisturbed without Jesus. Jesus then began to explain to them, using the teachings of Moses and the Prophets, how these events fulfilled the prophecies concerning his suffering and eventual glory.

As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus acted as if he were going farther. But they urged him strongly, "Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is almost over." So he went in to stay with them. When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them. Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight. They asked each other, "Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?"

Two disciples, having witnessed a remarkable event, returned to Jerusalem and reported it to the others, but their account was met with disbelief. Upon arriving, they found the Eleven and those gathered with them assembled and proclaiming, “It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon.” The two disciples then recounted their journey and described how Jesus had been recognized by them when he broke the bread, confirming the truth of the resurrection.

On the evening of the first day of the week, as the disciples were gathered with the doors locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus appeared to them and said, “Peace be with you!” Startled and frightened, they initially thought they were seeing a ghost, rebuked by Jesus for their lack of faith and stubborn refusal to believe those who had previously witnessed his resurrection. Jesus then stood among them, demonstrating his presence by saying, “It is I myself!” He showed them his hands and feet, urging them to touch him and see, explaining that a ghost lacks flesh and bones. Despite their joy and amazement, they still struggled to believe. Jesus then asked if they had anything to eat, and they offered him a piece of broiled fish, which he ate before them. Later, Jesus appeared to the Eleven as they were eating, again rebuking them for their continued lack of faith and their resistance to accepting the accounts of those who had seen him after his resurrection.

Again Jesus said, "Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I am sending you." And with that he breathed on them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive anyone his sins, they are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven."

He said to them, "This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms." Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures. He told them, "This is what is written: The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day, and repentance and forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things.
